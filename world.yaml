# What's this world called?
name: Kathaél

# Core concept
description: |
  Kathaél is a luminous, enchanted realm shaped by the **inner courage** of its inhabitants.
  Every honest or heartfelt choice becomes a glowing thread in the **Heart-Loom**, a living
  tapestry that binds the world together. Landscapes subtly shift in response to sincerity:
  paths open, soft lights appear, and magical creatures stir awake. Each child's story unfolds
  in a different region, but key decisions send ripples across the realm, creating moments where
  their journeys **intersect**. These interlocking points are called **Narrative Nodes**, where
  characters' choices align and reveal new possibilities. Kathaél exists outside ordinary
  time — a story-realm built around wonder, connection, and the quiet bravery of choosing what
  matters.

# What's the visual style?
# How does this world look? What's the aesthetic, color palette, atmosphere?
# This is used for prompting the visual system.
visual_style:
  - Watercolor Etherealism with Fine Ink Linework - soft watercolor washes paired with delicate ink lines, dreamlike yet grounded
  - Colors blend gently with mist blues, warm creams, honey golds, with brighter jewel tones appearing when magic stirs
  - The atmosphere feels warm, intimate, and slightly glowing, as if courage adds its own light to the scene
  - Magical elements are subtle - a shimmer around leaves, gold flecks in waterfalls, or luminous threads drifting through the air
  - Settings include responsive forests, glowing meadows, cozy lantern-lit villages, and ancient bridges of starlight
  - Everything looks hand-painted, organic, and quietly enchanted
  - A world where emotion shapes the landscape and children's choices guide the way
  - When the Heart-Loom is active, glowing golden threads appear in the air, weaving through scenes
  - Narrative Nodes manifest as points of radiant light where paths or landscapes align

# Characters in this world
characters:
  - id: no
    name: Noah
    file: no-noah.yaml
  - id: el
    name: Elise
    file: el-elise.yaml

# === NARRATIVE NODE SYSTEM ===
#
# Narrative Nodes connect character stories at synchronized spread numbers.
# Three types of nodes create different kinds of connections:
#
# 1. MEETING NODE - Characters physically converge
#    - Same location, same time
#    - Shared scene with POV variants
#    - Characters interact directly
#
# 2. MIRRORED NODE - Parallel challenges, themes rhyme
#    - Different locations, shared theme
#    - Symbolic motif appears in all stories
#    - Characters face similar challenges apart
#
# 3. RESONANT NODE - Emotional ripple across distance
#    - Emotional connection without proximity
#    - One character's growth affects another's world
#    - Must follow a character growth moment

  mirrored:
    name: Mirrored Node
    file_pattern: "cc-pp.yaml + mirrored-pp.yaml"  # Separate files + definition
    description: Characters face parallel challenges in different places
    visual_manifestation: Symbolic motif appears in each character's scene
