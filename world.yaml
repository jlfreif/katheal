visual_style:
  - Floating islands of land connected by shifting starlight bridges
  - Forests where trees grow in spirals, each trunk etched with faint constellations
  - Rivers that flow upward at dusk and become glowing streams of light
  - Animals that shimmer with fragments of forgotten tales
  - The world feels alive, intelligent, and responsive—almost as if it's watching Noah
  - Bold, glowing, high-contrast aesthetic—like a magical world halfway between Studio Ghibli, Hades (the game), and Spider-Verse

  # Atmosphere: Adventure, Mystery, and Intelligent Magic
