SPREAD 4: Attempt #2 (ask the expert)
[MEETING NODE]

Maya and little Mona find each other at a studio where colors refuse to stay on canvas, discovering that creative courage might hold an unexpected answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
A magical artist's studio built in the branches of an ancient tree, sunlight streaming through large windows. Canvases line the walls, but their paintings are fading like watercolors left in rain. Maya (9 years old, sandy-blond hair with pink streak, bold and athletic) stands at an easel, brush in hand, watching in frustration as the blue she just applied drains to gray. Paint supplies scatter the wooden floor. Through the window, golden threads drift past, their light flickering weakly.

[TEXT]
Maya dragged her brush across the canvas. Brilliant blue bloomed for just a second, then faded to nothing. "Come on," she muttered, trying again. Same thing. Every color she tried turned gray within heartbeats. The studio that usually burst with life felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for something.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Little Mona (2 years old, dark curly hair, bright curious eyes) sits on a stool beside Maya, painting with fearless abandon. Where Mona's brush touches the canvas, colors STAY - vivid reds, brilliant yellows, deep purples. Maya leans in, amazed, watching this tiny artist create with complete confidence. Mona grins, tilting her head as she adds another bold stroke. The golden threads outside pulse brighter, responding to Mona's courage. Maya's canvas begins to hold color where she paints without fear.

[TEXT]
A small voice piped up. "Paint with me!" Mona stood at the next easel, her brush already moving. Where she painted, colors blazed and held. Maya stared. "How are you doing that?" Mona giggled, adding a sunburst of yellow. "Just be you!" Maya took a breath, pushed away her worries, and painted. This time, the color stayed.

SPREAD 6: Midpoint: new insight / pattern
[MEETING NODE]

Elise finds Mona quietly sitting and observing, and begins a slow, meditative dance beside her. Together their gentle presence reveals that threads respond to peaceful attention rather than force.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
A serene glade carpeted with soft emerald moss and dotted with small luminous mushrooms. Golden threads flow through the air like gentle streams of light, weaving between ancient trees. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair, slim and graceful) steps into the clearing, catching her breath from running. She spots little Mona (2 years old, dark curly hair, bright curious eyes) sitting cross-legged on the moss, perfectly still, just watching the threads dance. The light is soft and warm, creating a peaceful atmosphere.

[TEXT]
Elise had tried everything. Pulling threads, painting patterns, forcing her dance to be bigger. Nothing worked. She stepped into the quiet glade and stopped. A tiny girl sat in the moss, utterly still, watching golden threads flow past her face. The threads seemed... calmer here. Gentler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Mona sits cross-legged on the moss, perfectly still, watching. Beside her, Elise moves in slow, meditative dance—arms flowing like gentle water, turns measured and peaceful. The golden threads flow closer to both of them, drawn by their quiet presence. One thread hovers near Mona's palm while another weaves around Elise's gracefully extended hand. Elise's expression shows dawning realization. Soft particles of light drift through the air like gentle snow.

[TEXT]
Elise began to dance beside Mona, but this time differently. Slow. Meditative. Her arms flowed like gentle water, each turn measured and peaceful. The threads drifted closer, curious about their quiet presence. "Soft," Mona whispered. "Gentle." Elise nodded, continuing her flowing dance. The threads had been running from force. But here, with gentle movement and patient presence, they came willingly. "You're right," Elise breathed. "Gentle can be strong."

SPREAD 10: Climax: big action
[MEETING NODE]

All six children converge at the Heart Crystal's base as it fractures and dims, each bringing their unique courage to mend the realm's core together.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 23 (Left) - Facing the final challenge together
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
The Heart Crystal rises like a building before six children gathered in a circle at its base. The massive crystalline structure shows deep fractures, each crack glowing with escaping golden light. Noah (12, sandy blond hair), Max (12, red hair, tall), and Micah (9, black hair, athletic) stand on one side. Elise (9, long brown hair, graceful), Maya (9, sandy-blond with pink streak, bold stance), and little Mona (2, dark curly hair, bright-eyed) stand on the other. Each child reaches toward a different facet of the Crystal, hesitation visible in their postures. The forest clearing pulses with dimming light.

[TEXT]
The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracks spreading like lightning across its surface. Golden light leaked from every fracture, stories dissolving into nothing. Noah glanced at the others. Max nodded. Maya took a breath. Elise stepped closer. Micah steadied himself. Even little Mona reached up with both hands, determined.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 24 (Right) - Taking decisive action - the moment of convergence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
All six children press their hands against the Crystal simultaneously. Each facet they touch glows brilliant gold, and streams of light spiral upward from their palms into the structure. The cracks begin to seal, golden threads weaving through them like stitches. The children's faces show fierce concentration and wonder. Light radiates from the Crystal's core, growing brighter and more stable. The whole clearing illuminates with warm, pulsing radiance as the Crystal hums with restored power.

[TEXT]
"Now," Noah called. Six hands touched six facets at once. The Crystal blazed warm beneath their palms, humming like a struck bell. Light surged through the cracks, knitting them closed. "Don't let go," Max shouted over the rising sound. The threads poured from their courage, weaving into the Crystal. Mona laughed, pure and bright. The Heart Crystal sang, whole again.
