Maya dragged her brush across the canvas. Brilliant blue bloomed for just a second,
then faded to nothing. "Come on," she muttered, trying again. Same thing. Every
color she tried turned gray within heartbeats. The studio that usually burst with
life felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for something.


A small voice piped up. "Paint with me!" Mona stood at the next easel, her brush
already moving. Where she painted, colors blazed and held. Maya stared. "How are
you doing that?" Mona giggled, adding a sunburst of yellow. "Just be you!" Maya
took a breath, pushed away her worries, and painted. This time, the color stayed.

Elise had tried everything. Pulling threads, painting patterns, forcing her dance
to be bigger. Nothing worked. She stepped into the quiet glade and stopped. A tiny
girl sat in the moss, utterly still, watching golden threads flow past her face.
The threads seemed... calmer here. Gentler.


Elise began to dance beside Mona, but this time differently. Slow. Meditative.
Her arms flowed like gentle water, each turn measured and peaceful. The threads
drifted closer, curious about their quiet presence. "Soft," Mona whispered.
"Gentle." Elise nodded, continuing her flowing dance. The threads had been running
from force. But here, with gentle movement and patient presence, they came willingly.
"You're right," Elise breathed. "Gentle can be strong."

The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracks spreading like lightning across its
surface. Golden light leaked from every fracture, stories dissolving into nothing.
Noah glanced at the others. Max nodded. Maya took a breath. Elise stepped closer.
Micah steadied himself. Even little Mona reached up with both hands, determined.


"Now," Noah called. Six hands touched six facets at once. The Crystal blazed warm
beneath their palms, humming like a struck bell. Light surged through the cracks,
knitting them closed. "Don't let go," Max shouted over the rising sound. The
threads poured from their courage, weaving into the Crystal. Mona laughed, pure and
bright. The Heart Crystal sang, whole again.
