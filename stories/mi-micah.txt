Elise danced into the grove and stopped mid-turn, breathless. Performers everywhere,
frozen like statues. A dancer hung mid-leap, one foot pointed, arms spread—exactly
the pose Elise had just been practicing. Musicians held silent instruments. Even
the trees seemed to hold their breath. "What happened to you?" she whispered,
reaching toward the dancer's outstretched hand.


A sound made her turn. Micah stood on the other side of the frozen dancer, his
hand extended just like hers. "Elise!" His face broke into a grin despite the
strangeness around them. "You see it too. They're stuck." She nodded. "The magic
is fading." Micah's expression turned serious. "Then let's fix it. Together."

Noah sat with his head in his hands. Every brilliant idea had failed. The threads
hung lifeless, ignoring him. Footsteps approached, and he didn't even look up until
a familiar voice said, "Noah?" His cousin Micah dropped onto the log beside him,
just as tired, just as discouraged. "I can't do this," Noah whispered.


"Breathe with me," Micah said quietly. "In. Out." Noah matched his cousin's rhythm.
In. Hold. Out. Slowly. The tightness in his chest eased. His racing thoughts slowed.
The threads overhead stirred, pulsing with their breath. "Better?" Micah asked.
Noah nodded. "Yeah. We're not done yet." "No way," Micah grinned. "We're just getting started."

The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracks spreading like lightning across its
surface. Golden light leaked from every fracture, stories dissolving into nothing.
Noah glanced at the others. Max nodded. Maya took a breath. Elise stepped closer.
Micah steadied himself. Even little Mona reached up with both hands, determined.


"Now," Noah called. Six hands touched six facets at once. The Crystal blazed warm
beneath their palms, humming like a struck bell. Light surged through the cracks,
knitting them closed. "Don't let go," Max shouted over the rising sound. The
threads poured from their courage, weaving into the Crystal. Mona laughed, pure and
bright. The Heart Crystal sang, whole again.
