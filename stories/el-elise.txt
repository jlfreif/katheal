SPREAD 1: Ordinary world + desire hint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Elise spun slowly in front of her mirror, arms flowing like water. She was creating
a dance about a forest path she'd drawn earlier—each movement telling the story her
pictures couldn't quite capture. Her feet traced patterns on the floor. She hummed
a melody that matched her turns. This was how she thought best: through movement,
through dance.


She spun toward the wall and froze mid-movement. The flower in her drawing was
glowing. Elise blinked, but the light didn't disappear. It pulsed softly, like
a tiny heartbeat, warm and golden in a way that had nothing to do with her lamp.
Her body swayed toward it instinctively, pulled by curiosity. She stepped closer,
watching the impossible light breathe.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 2: Inciting incident
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Elise danced into the grove and stopped mid-turn, breathless. Performers everywhere,
frozen like statues. A dancer hung mid-leap, one foot pointed, arms spread—exactly
the pose Elise had just been practicing. Musicians held silent instruments. Even
the trees seemed to hold their breath. "What happened to you?" she whispered,
reaching toward the dancer's outstretched hand.


A sound made her turn. Micah stood on the other side of the frozen dancer, his
hand extended just like hers. "Elise!" His face broke into a grin despite the
strangeness around them. "You see it too. They're stuck." She nodded. "The magic
is fading." Micah's expression turned serious. "Then let's fix it. Together."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 3: Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like wind
itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life! Her feet pounded
the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely stirred. She landed
hard and spun again. Nothing. In the distance, someone moved through the grey
blooms with slow, graceful turns—so different from Maya's style.


"Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop mid-leap. Her cousin looked up from her dance,
arms still extended in a graceful line. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright and
startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said at exactly
the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if recognizing their connection.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 4: Attempt #2 (ask the expert)
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


"I've tried everything." Noah followed the threads to a crossroads beneath
an ancient willow, hoping someone here might know what he was missing. The
Crystal glowed through the trees, dimmer than before, more threads
unraveling. He reached toward one, and it hummed warmly. But the path it
suggested led deeper into unfamiliar territory.


Noah spotted her at the same moment she spotted him. A girl moving through the
light with graceful, flowing gestures, reaching for the threads just like he was.
"Are you trying to help them too?" he called. She nodded, arms still extended.
"They keep rejecting everything I try." "Same." Something warm spread through his
chest. He wasn't alone in this. The threads between them pulsed brighter and felt
warm, like sunshine on skin.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 5: Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The plaza looked worse than anywhere else. Trees stood grey as pencil sketches,
their shimmer completely gone. The ground, which should have glowed, was as
dull as pavement. Elise clutched her watercolor set to her chest, her heart
sinking. If her gentle approach couldn't help a single flower, how could she
possibly restore all of this?


"Bold!" The artist-spirit swept enormous brushes through the air, splattering
neon colors everywhere. "Loud! That's how you fix fading!" Elise looked at
the trees the spirit had painted: harsh orange, electric purple, colors that
hurt to see. The watching animals had fled. Something in Elise's chest pulled
tight. This felt wrong. Very wrong.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 6: Midpoint: new insight / pattern
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Elise had tried everything. Pulling threads, painting patterns, forcing her dance
to be bigger. Nothing worked. She stepped into the quiet glade and stopped. A tiny
girl sat in the moss, utterly still, watching golden threads flow past her face.
The threads seemed... calmer here. Gentler.


Elise began to dance beside Mona, but this time differently. Slow. Meditative.
Her arms flowed like gentle water, each turn measured and peaceful. The threads
drifted closer, curious about their quiet presence. "Soft," Mona whispered.
"Gentle." Elise nodded, continuing her flowing dance. The threads had been running
from force. But here, with gentle movement and patient presence, they came willingly.
"You're right," Elise breathed. "Gentle can be strong."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 7: Rising stakes: almost works
[MIRRORED NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Flower by flower, Elise danced them back to life. She moved through the meadow
with gentle turns and flowing gestures, and where her dance touched, blooms
remembered their beauty. The lantern nearby burned steady, its flame matching
her calm focus. She'd found the answer. This was working.


Then Elise stopped and looked up. The meadow stretched forever. Thousands of
grey flowers, tens of thousands, more than she could ever reach. The lantern
flame wavered as her heart sank. Her gentle dance worked, but it was so slow.
How could one quiet movement, one flower at a time, matter against all this grey?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 8: All-is-lost / emotional low
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The garden stretched forever. Thousands of flowers, all grey. Elise spun from
bloom to bloom, dancing as fast as she could, trying to restore them all. Her
gentle approach had worked on a few flowers, but looking at this vast emptiness,
those few felt like nothing. So she danced harder, faster, pushing herself to
cover more ground.


Her legs gave out. Elise collapsed on the ground, too exhausted to move, tears
sliding down her cheeks. She'd tried to dance through the whole garden. Tried
to be big enough, fast enough, strong enough. But she was too small. Too gentle.
Too slow. How could one nine-year-old who just danced quietly possibly matter
against all this grey?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 9: Deepening choice / inner shift
[RESONANT NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Through her tears, Elise saw one flower still glowing. Just one, from her
earlier dance, holding its color against all the grey. It was tiny. It was
almost nothing. But it was real. She pushed herself to her feet, legs still
shaking. If one flower could matter, then the next one could too. She began
to move again—slow, gentle, her true way.


Golden light rippled through the air, threads she'd never seen before,
connecting the whole meadow. Elise danced, slow and gentle, and felt warmth
spread through her chest—like someone somewhere was choosing the same courage
she was. Flowers near her feet began to glow as she moved past, responding to
her dance without her even trying. She wasn't doing this alone.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 10: Climax: big action
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracks spreading like lightning across its
surface. Golden light leaked from every fracture, stories dissolving into nothing.
Noah glanced at the others. Max nodded. Maya took a breath. Elise stepped closer.
Micah steadied himself. Even little Mona reached up with both hands, determined.


"Now," Noah called. Six hands touched six facets at once. The Crystal blazed warm
beneath their palms, humming like a struck bell. Light surged through the cracks,
knitting them closed. "Don't let go," Max shouted over the rising sound. The
threads poured from their courage, weaving into the Crystal. Mona laughed, pure and
bright. The Heart Crystal sang, whole again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Color spread through Kathaél like watercolor on wet paper, gentle and alive.
The threads glowed with soft hues: lavender, rose, sage, sky blue. Elise
watched her small light become something vast and beautiful. Then warmth
gathered in her palms, forming into a paintbrush of starlight. A gift. Proof
that noticing mattered.


Elise tucked the paintbrush into her pocket, where it hummed with soft warmth.
The path home was lined with flowers that hadn't been there before, blooming
in colors she had helped remember. A rabbit hopped beside her for a few steps.
A deer bowed its head as she passed. Even leaving, she felt like she belonged.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 12: Resolution (emotional) + series button
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Elise's room looked exactly the same: drawings on the wall, art supplies
scattered in their familiar mess, mirror reflecting the afternoon light.
But when she stood in front of the mirror and began to dance, something was
different. She moved with the same gentle grace, but now she knew—truly
knew—that her quiet way mattered.


She spun slowly, arms flowing like water, and watched herself in the mirror.
The same girl. The same gentle movements. But now she understood that flowing
could be as powerful as forcing, that quiet could change the world. Her dance
was exactly enough. Outside her window, an ordinary butterfly sat on the sill,
its wings catching light. Elise smiled and kept dancing.
