SPREAD 1: Ordinary world + desire hint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maya's brush swept across the paper in bold strokes—bright pink, electric
blue, sunshine yellow. She was painting a dancer mid-leap, all energy
and motion. "That's not right," she muttered, adding more pink. Then
more blue. The painting got louder, bolder, more Maya. Her cousin Elise
would probably paint it gentle and perfect. But Maya liked it loud.


The dancer on her paper started to glow. Maya blinked, but the light
didn't fade. It pulsed softly, goldenly, moving like the figure wanted
to dance right off the page. Her paint couldn't do that. She leaned
closer, brush forgotten. The glow brightened as if responding to her
attention. "Whoa," Maya breathed. "Are you magic?"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 2: Inciting incident
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When Maya touched the glowing dancer, the painting opened like a door.
Through it she saw a meadow filled with frozen performances—dancers
stuck mid-leap, musicians silent with instruments raised, performers
captured in moments that should have flowed into the next. Golden threads
connected them all, flickering like candles about to die. Something was
very wrong.


Maya stepped through, and her bedroom dissolved like watercolor in rain.
The meadow surrounded her, silent where it should have been full of music
and movement. She spun experimentally, and the frozen dancers seemed to
sway toward her, yearning. "You need someone to help you finish," Maya
understood. She grinned, bold and ready. "Perfect. I love a challenge."

SPREAD 3: Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like wind
itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life! Her feet pounded
the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely stirred. She landed
hard and spun again. Nothing. In the distance, someone moved through the grey
blooms with slow, graceful turns—so different from Maya's style.


"Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop mid-leap. Her cousin looked up from her dance,
arms still extended in a graceful line. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright and
startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said at exactly
the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if recognizing their connection.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 4: Attempt #2 (ask the expert)
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maya dragged her brush across the canvas. Brilliant blue bloomed for just a second,
then faded to nothing. "Come on," she muttered, trying again. Same thing. Every
color she tried turned gray within heartbeats. The studio that usually burst with
life felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for something.


A small voice piped up. "Paint with me!" Mona stood at the next easel, her brush
already moving. Where she painted, colors blazed and held. Maya stared. "How are
you doing that?" Mona giggled, adding a sunburst of yellow. "Just be you!" Maya
took a breath, pushed away her worries, and painted. This time, the color stayed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 5: Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The amphitheater stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen performances
filled every stage, every platform, every corner. Dancers stuck mid-leap.
Singers frozen on their notes. Artists captured mid-brushstroke. The
Crystal pulsed dimmer in the distance. A nearby dancer crumbled to dust,
her performance lost forever. "Oh no," Maya whispered. "This is really,
really bad."


"Posture!" A performer in elaborate costume snapped fingers at Maya.
"Technique! Form! You must perform CORRECTLY!" They demonstrated perfect
rigid movements, each gesture sharp and controlled. Maya tried to copy,
but her body wanted to flow and bounce and add her own flair. The frozen
dancers around them seemed to strain harder, as if the rules were choking
them. "This feels wrong," Maya said quietly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 6: Midpoint: new insight / pattern
[MIRRORED NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maya sat down hard, too tired to keep dancing. One shadow-audience wanted
big leaps, another wanted gentle twirls, another wanted perfect technique.
She'd tried to give them all what they asked for, and none of it felt
right. The compass beside her spun in confused circles. She hugged her
knees. "I don't even know what I want anymore."


Maya stood. She started dancing again, but this time for herself. Bold
leaps mixed with silly spins. Her pink-streaked hair flying. Not perfect,
not proper, just...Maya. The shadow-audiences dissolved like smoke. The
compass needle swung toward her and held steady, pointing at her heart.
Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage, bright and real and
exactly right.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 7: Rising stakes: almost works
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The bridge stretched between them, made of starlight that wouldn't quite hold still.
Maya tested it with one foot. It rippled like water. "Guess I'm trying this," she
called across to the red-haired boy on the other side. "Me too," Max shouted back.
They stepped on at the same moment. The bridge shuddered, then hummed.


With each step they took, the bridge grew more solid. Where they met in the middle,
it blazed steady and strong. "It's working," Maya laughed. "Together," Max agreed,
high-fiving her. But ahead, the path disappeared into mist. The bridge showed them
something else was needed. Something distant. They'd have to find the others.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 8: All-is-lost / emotional low
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The amphitheater filled with shadow-audiences, all judging. One section
wanted perfect ballet. Another wanted serious art. Another wanted her
to stop being so loud, so bold, so much. Dark clouds gathered. The
Crystal cracked louder. A performance beside her dissolved into smoke.
"I'm just me," Maya whispered. "Is that really not enough?"


Maya sank down onto the stage, trying to make herself smaller. Maybe
everyone was right. Maybe her wild dancing and mixed styles and loud
colors were just showing off. Maybe she should be more like... she didn't
even know who. The butterfly landed nearby, its wings grey. But Maya
noticed it hadn't flown away. And one thread still glowed, faint but real.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 9: Deepening choice / inner shift
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maya stood. The shadow-audiences were still there, still judging. But
she remembered her bedroom, painting dancers because she loved how they
moved. Not for teachers. Not for perfect technique. For the joy of it.
"I didn't come here to perform for you," Maya said to the shadows. Her
voice grew stronger. "I came here to be myself."


Maya danced—big bold leaps, silly spins, mixing ballet with hip-hop
with moves she just invented. The shadow-audiences dissolved. Golden
light rippled through the air, warm as a hug from someone far away being
brave at exactly the same moment. The butterfly's wings burst into color.
Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage. "Being myself," Maya
laughed, "is exactly enough."

SPREAD 10: Climax: big action
[MEETING NODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracks spreading like lightning across its
surface. Golden light leaked from every fracture, stories dissolving into nothing.
Noah glanced at the others. Max nodded. Maya took a breath. Elise stepped closer.
Micah steadied himself. Even little Mona reached up with both hands, determined.


"Now," Noah called. Six hands touched six facets at once. The Crystal blazed warm
beneath their palms, humming like a struck bell. Light surged through the cracks,
knitting them closed. "Don't let go," Max shouted over the rising sound. The
threads poured from their courage, weaving into the Crystal. Mona laughed, pure and
bright. The Heart Crystal sang, whole again.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 11: Resolution (external)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Crystal blazed with every color Maya had ever loved and some she'd
never imagined. Her wild authentic performance wove itself into the
pattern, and somehow its boldness made everything more beautiful. Light
gathered in her palms until a paint pot appeared—small, perfect, filled
with colors that glowed and shifted. The butterfly landed on her shoulder,
wings brilliant. "I was always enough," Maya breathed.


Maya walked home, the paint pot warm in her hands. All around, frozen
performances finished themselves—each dancer finding their own style,
each artist creating their own truth. A fox danced past and Maya laughed,
spinning with it. "Thank you," she called to Kathaél. The window to her
bedroom gleamed ahead, her bold colorful paintings waiting.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPREAD 12: Resolution (emotional) + series button
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maya's bedroom looked the same: afternoon light, paint everywhere, music
playing softly. But she didn't feel the same. She picked up her brush
and opened the magical paint pot. The colors inside shifted and glowed,
responding to her boldness. "Okay," she said to her blank paper. "Let's
make something wild and true."


Maya painted like herself—big bold strokes, colors that clashed and sang,
energy that couldn't be contained. Not perfect. Not proper. Just true.
Parts of her painting glowed with golden light, the same light she'd
brought to Kathaél. Outside her window, a golden thread danced in Madrid
sunlight. The butterfly from the meadow sat on her sill, wings brilliant.
Maya grinned. "Being yourself," she said, "is the best adventure."
