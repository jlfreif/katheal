SPREAD 1: Ordinary world + desire hint

Maya paints in her Madrid bedroom, creating bold colorful art, until a shimmer of light appears that doesn't match her paints.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 5 (Left) - Character in their ordinary world
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya sits cross-legged on her bedroom floor surrounded by paint supplies, her pink-streaked sandy-blond hair catching afternoon light from the window. Bold colorful paintings cover the walls. She's painting a dance scene with energetic brushstrokes, tongue poking out in concentration. Music plays softly in the background.

[TEXT]
Maya's brush swept across the paper in bold strokes—bright pink, electric blue, sunshine yellow. She was painting a dancer mid-leap, all energy and motion. "That's not right," she muttered, adding more pink. Then more blue. The painting got louder, bolder, more Maya. Her cousin Elise would probably paint it gentle and perfect. But Maya liked it loud.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 6 (Right) - First hint of something different
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya freezes, paintbrush hovering, as the painted dancer on her paper begins to glow with golden light that has nothing to do with her paints. The glow pulses gently, inviting. Her eyes widen with delighted curiosity. Pink paint drips forgotten from her brush. The light seems to dance in rhythm with music only it can hear.

[TEXT]
The dancer on her paper started to glow. Maya blinked, but the light didn't fade. It pulsed softly, goldenly, moving like the figure wanted to dance right off the page. Her paint couldn't do that. She leaned closer, brush forgotten. The glow brightened as if responding to her attention. "Whoa," Maya breathed. "Are you magic?"


================================================================================
SPREAD 2: Inciting incident

Maya touches the glowing dancer and finds herself pulled into Kathaél, where performances and dances are frozen mid-movement.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 7 (Left) - Discovery of the problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya stands between worlds, her paint-stained fingers touching a shimmering portal where her painting transformed into a doorway. Through it, she sees a meadow with frozen dancers—shadow figures stuck mid-leap, mid-spin, unable to complete their movements. Golden threads connect them but flicker weakly. Her athletic build is poised on tiptoes, ready to leap through.

[TEXT]
When Maya touched the glowing dancer, the painting opened like a door. Through it she saw a meadow filled with frozen performances—dancers stuck mid-leap, musicians silent with instruments raised, performers captured in moments that should have flowed into the next. Golden threads connected them all, flickering like candles about to die. Something was very wrong.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 8 (Right) - Decision to act
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya steps fully into Kathaél, standing in the meadow of frozen performances. Her Madrid bedroom fades to translucent behind her. She spins once, testing the space, and frozen dancers seem to lean toward her motion. Golden threads from the Heart Crystal drift closer. Her expression shows bold determination mixed with excited curiosity.

[TEXT]
Maya stepped through, and her bedroom dissolved like watercolor in rain. The meadow surrounded her, silent where it should have been full of music and movement. She spun experimentally, and the frozen dancers seemed to sway toward her, yearning. "You need someone to help you finish," Maya understood. She grinned, bold and ready. "Perfect. I love a challenge."


================================================================================
SPREAD 3: Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)
[MEETING NODE]

Maya and Elise discover each other in a fading meadow, both trying to bring color back through dance. Maya's bold, energetic style and Elise's graceful, flowing style each fail alone, but they recognize each other with joy.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 9 (Left) - Trying the obvious solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya leaps high in the center of a faded meadow, arms stretched wide, hair with its pink streak flying as she spins with bold, explosive energy. Her movements are powerful and decisive. Grey flowers surround her, barely stirring. In the distance, another figure moves through the flowers with slow, graceful gestures—arms flowing like water, turning in lyrical circles.

[TEXT]
Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like wind itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life! Her feet pounded the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely stirred. She landed hard and spun again. Nothing. In the distance, someone moved through the grey blooms with slow, graceful turns—so different from Maya's style.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 10 (Right) - Realizing it doesn't work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Elise stands in a graceful pose, arms extended, having just completed a flowing turn, as Maya bounds over mid-leap. Both girls freeze as recognition hits. Maya's expression shifts from determined to shocked to delighted. Elise's eyes widen with surprise and joy. Grey flowers surround them. Golden threads pulse overhead, connecting their presence.

[TEXT]
"Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop mid-leap. Her cousin looked up from her dance, arms still extended in a graceful line. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright and startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said at exactly the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if recognizing their connection.


================================================================================
SPREAD 4: Attempt #2 (ask the expert)
[MEETING NODE]

Maya and little Mona find each other at a studio where colors refuse to stay on canvas, discovering that creative courage might hold an unexpected answer.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 11 (Left) - Seeking guidance from creativity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
A magical artist's studio built in the branches of an ancient tree, sunlight streaming through large windows. Canvases line the walls, but their paintings are fading like watercolors left in rain. Maya (9 years old, sandy-blond hair with pink streak, bold and athletic) stands at an easel, brush in hand, watching in frustration as the blue she just applied drains to gray. Paint supplies scatter the wooden floor. Through the window, golden threads drift past, their light flickering weakly.

[TEXT]
Maya dragged her brush across the canvas. Brilliant blue bloomed for just a second, then faded to nothing. "Come on," she muttered, trying again. Same thing. Every color she tried turned gray within heartbeats. The studio that usually burst with life felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for something.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction through fearless creativity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Little Mona (2 years old, dark curly hair, bright curious eyes) sits on a stool beside Maya, painting with fearless abandon. Where Mona's brush touches the canvas, colors STAY - vivid reds, brilliant yellows, deep purples. Maya leans in, amazed, watching this tiny artist create with complete confidence. Mona grins, tilting her head as she adds another bold stroke. The golden threads outside pulse brighter, responding to Mona's courage. Maya's canvas begins to hold color where she paints without fear.

[TEXT]
A small voice piped up. "Paint with me!" Mona stood at the next easel, her brush already moving. Where she painted, colors blazed and held. Maya stared. "How are you doing that?" Mona giggled, adding a sunburst of yellow. "Just be you!" Maya took a breath, pushed away her worries, and painted. This time, the color stayed.


================================================================================
SPREAD 5: Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)

Maya enters a vast performance space where hundreds of shows are frozen, and meets a performer who insists on rigid perfection.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 13 (Left) - Entering unfamiliar territory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya stands at the edge of an enormous amphitheater where hundreds of frozen performances fill the space—dancers mid-leap, singers with mouths open, artists with brushes raised. All stuck. All silent. The Heart Crystal pulses dimly in the distance. A nearby dancer crumbles to dust. Maya's eyes widen with alarm at the scale.

[TEXT]
The amphitheater stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen performances filled every stage, every platform, every corner. Dancers stuck mid-leap. Singers frozen on their notes. Artists captured mid-brushstroke. The Crystal pulsed dimmer in the distance. A nearby dancer crumbled to dust, her performance lost forever. "Oh no," Maya whispered. "This is really, really bad."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 14 (Right) - Encountering misleading help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
A dramatic performer in elaborate costume gestures sharply, demonstrating perfect rigid technique. Behind them, frozen dancers strain against invisible rules. The performer snaps at Maya to stand straighter, point her toes more, stop moving so wildly. Maya's natural flowing style clashes with the rigid demands. Her expression shows doubt and discomfort.

[TEXT]
"Posture!" A performer in elaborate costume snapped fingers at Maya. "Technique! Form! You must perform CORRECTLY!" They demonstrated perfect rigid movements, each gesture sharp and controlled. Maya tried to copy, but her body wanted to flow and bounce and add her own flair. The frozen dancers around them seemed to strain harder, as if the rules were choking them. "This feels wrong," Maya said quietly.


================================================================================
SPREAD 6: Midpoint: new insight / pattern
[MIRRORED NODE]

Maya exhausts herself trying to perform what shadow-audiences want, then discovers that being authentically herself is her true power.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 15 (Left) - Recognizing what doesn't work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya sits cross-legged at the edge of an empty amphitheater stage, breathing hard. Shadow-audiences fill the seats, each row demanding something different. Her pink-streaked hair is disheveled. A compass rests beside her, its needle spinning wildly. She looks exhausted and small.

[TEXT]
Maya sat down hard, too tired to keep dancing. One shadow-audience wanted big leaps, another wanted gentle twirls, another wanted perfect technique. She'd tried to give them all what they asked for, and none of it felt right. The compass beside her spun in confused circles. She hugged her knees. "I don't even know what I want anymore."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 16 (Right) - Discovering a new pattern
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya stands center stage and dances her own way—bold, playful, mixing styles without caring about perfect form. The shadow-audiences fade away. The compass's needle points straight at her heart, glowing. Real flowers bloom at her feet with each authentic movement, their colors bright and true.

[TEXT]
Maya stood. She started dancing again, but this time for herself. Bold leaps mixed with silly spins. Her pink-streaked hair flying. Not perfect, not proper, just...Maya. The shadow-audiences dissolved like smoke. The compass needle swung toward her and held steady, pointing at her heart. Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage, bright and real and exactly right.


================================================================================
SPREAD 7: Rising stakes: almost works
[MEETING NODE]

Maya and Max meet at a bridge of starlight, each having discovered their authentic courage, and realize they can accomplish together what neither could alone.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 17 (Left) - Making progress toward goal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
An ancient bridge spanning a deep ravine, constructed entirely of crystallized starlight that shimmers and shifts like liquid light made solid. Maya (9 years old, sandy-blond hair with pink streak, bold and athletic) stands at one end, one foot testing the bridge's surface which ripples under her weight. Max (12 years old, straight red hair, tall and slim) stands at the opposite end, also testing the bridge. The structure flickers between solid and translucent. Mist swirls in the ravine far below. Golden threads weave through the starlight, pulsing gently.

[TEXT]
The bridge stretched between them, made of starlight that wouldn't quite hold still. Maya tested it with one foot. It rippled like water. "Guess I'm trying this," she called across to the red-haired boy on the other side. "Me too," Max shouted back. They stepped on at the same moment. The bridge shuddered, then hummed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 18 (Right) - Realizing something is still missing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya and Max walk toward the center of the bridge from opposite ends, their combined weight and courage causing the starlight to crystallize and solidify beneath their feet. Where they meet in the middle, the bridge glows brightest and most stable. Both children grin at each other with recognition and relief. Golden threads spiral up from the bridge, forming a path forward. Behind them, the bridge remains semi-transparent, but ahead where they must go together, it becomes clearer and more solid. The ravine below still yawns dark and deep.

[TEXT]
With each step they took, the bridge grew more solid. Where they met in the middle, it blazed steady and strong. "It's working," Maya laughed. "Together," Max agreed, high-fiving her. But ahead, the path disappeared into mist. The bridge showed them something else was needed. Something distant. They'd have to find the others.


================================================================================
SPREAD 8: All-is-lost / emotional low

Maya stands before shadow-audiences that judge every move, believing her authentic self isn't enough to help.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 19 (Left) - External obstacles intensify
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya stands frozen center stage in a vast amphitheater packed with shadow-audiences, each row demanding something different from her. "Be proper!" "Stop showing off!" "Where's your training?" Dark clouds gather overhead. The Heart Crystal cracks audibly. A nearby performance dissolves into grey smoke. Her athletic frame looks small and vulnerable.

[TEXT]
The amphitheater filled with shadow-audiences, all judging. One section wanted perfect ballet. Another wanted serious art. Another wanted her to stop being so loud, so bold, so much. Dark clouds gathered. The Crystal cracked louder. A performance beside her dissolved into smoke. "I'm just me," Maya whispered. "Is that really not enough?"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 20 (Right) - Inner doubt and discouragement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya sits cross-legged on the empty stage, arms wrapped around herself, her pink-streaked hair hanging forward to hide her face. The shadow-audiences loom in the darkness. Her paint-stained hands rest empty in her lap. A small butterfly lands nearby, its wings dull grey. One weak thread glows faintly.

[TEXT]
Maya sank down onto the stage, trying to make herself smaller. Maybe everyone was right. Maybe her wild dancing and mixed styles and loud colors were just showing off. Maybe she should be more like... she didn't even know who. The butterfly landed nearby, its wings grey. But Maya noticed it hadn't flown away. And one thread still glowed, faint but real.


================================================================================
SPREAD 9: Deepening choice / inner shift

Maya remembers why she started dancing—for herself—and chooses to perform authentically regardless of judgment.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 21 (Left) - Making the choice to continue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya stands, pushing her pink-streaked hair back determinedly. The shadow-audiences still loom, but she's not looking at them anymore. She's looking at the grey butterfly, at the weak thread, at the empty stage that's waiting. Her posture shifts to bold and ready. Paint-stained hands open at her sides.

[TEXT]
Maya stood. The shadow-audiences were still there, still judging. But she remembered her bedroom, painting dancers because she loved how they moved. Not for teachers. Not for perfect technique. For the joy of it. "I didn't come here to perform for you," Maya said to the shadows. Her voice grew stronger. "I came here to be myself."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 22 (Right) - Discovering the missed clue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya dances boldly, authentically, mixing every style she loves. The shadow-audiences dissolve like smoke. Golden threads shimmer into visibility, connecting her to warmth beyond the stage—someone else choosing courage at the same moment. The butterfly's wings bloom with color. Flowers grow where she dances. The stage transforms.

[TEXT]
Maya danced—big bold leaps, silly spins, mixing ballet with hip-hop with moves she just invented. The shadow-audiences dissolved. Golden light rippled through the air, warm as a hug from someone far away being brave at exactly the same moment. The butterfly's wings burst into color. Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage. "Being myself," Maya laughed, "is exactly enough."


================================================================================
SPREAD 10: Climax: big action
[MEETING NODE]

All six children converge at the Heart Crystal's base as it fractures and dims, each bringing their unique courage to mend the realm's core together.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 23 (Left) - Facing the final challenge together
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
The Heart Crystal rises like a building before six children gathered in a circle at its base. The massive crystalline structure shows deep fractures, each crack glowing with escaping golden light. Noah (12, sandy blond hair), Max (12, red hair, tall), and Micah (9, black hair, athletic) stand on one side. Elise (9, long brown hair, graceful), Maya (9, sandy-blond with pink streak, bold stance), and little Mona (2, dark curly hair, bright-eyed) stand on the other. Each child reaches toward a different facet of the Crystal, hesitation visible in their postures. The forest clearing pulses with dimming light.

[TEXT]
The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracks spreading like lightning across its surface. Golden light leaked from every fracture, stories dissolving into nothing. Noah glanced at the others. Max nodded. Maya took a breath. Elise stepped closer. Micah steadied himself. Even little Mona reached up with both hands, determined.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 24 (Right) - Taking decisive action - the moment of convergence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
All six children press their hands against the Crystal simultaneously. Each facet they touch glows brilliant gold, and streams of light spiral upward from their palms into the structure. The cracks begin to seal, golden threads weaving through them like stitches. The children's faces show fierce concentration and wonder. Light radiates from the Crystal's core, growing brighter and more stable. The whole clearing illuminates with warm, pulsing radiance as the Crystal hums with restored power.

[TEXT]
"Now," Noah called. Six hands touched six facets at once. The Crystal blazed warm beneath their palms, humming like a struck bell. Light surged through the cracks, knitting them closed. "Don't let go," Max shouted over the rising sound. The threads poured from their courage, weaving into the Crystal. Mona laughed, pure and bright. The Heart Crystal sang, whole again.


================================================================================
SPREAD 11: Resolution (external)

The performance facet blazes with authentic expression, and Maya receives paint that glows with courage.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 25 (Left) - Goal achieved, external reward
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
The Heart Crystal blazes with every color imaginable, the performance facet spinning and dancing with light. Maya's authentic performance weaves into the structure, its wild energy making the whole crystal more vibrant. Between her hands appears a small paint pot filled with colors that shift and glow. The butterfly from before circles, wings brilliant.

[TEXT]
The Crystal blazed with every color Maya had ever loved and some she'd never imagined. Her wild authentic performance wove itself into the pattern, and somehow its boldness made everything more beautiful. Light gathered in her palms until a paint pot appeared—small, perfect, filled with colors that glowed and shifted. The butterfly landed on her shoulder, wings brilliant. "I was always enough," Maya breathed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 26 (Right) - Beginning the return
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya walks home along a path lined with performing flowers and dancing trees, the paint pot secure in her hands. Around her, frozen performances complete themselves—each one unique, authentic, true. A fox dances past. Her Madrid bedroom window glows warmly in the distance, her bold paintings visible through the glass.

[TEXT]
Maya walked home, the paint pot warm in her hands. All around, frozen performances finished themselves—each dancer finding their own style, each artist creating their own truth. A fox danced past and Maya laughed, spinning with it. "Thank you," she called to Kathaél. The window to her bedroom gleamed ahead, her bold colorful paintings waiting.


================================================================================
SPREAD 12: Resolution (emotional) + series button

Maya returns to her Madrid bedroom and her painting, but now she creates with full confidence in her authentic style.
================================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 27 (Left) - Returning to ordinary world
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya sits cross-legged on her bedroom floor in the same position as the opening, surrounded by paint supplies. But now the magical paint pot from Kathaél sits among her ordinary paints, glowing softly. Her pink-streaked hair catches light the same way, but her posture radiates confidence. The music plays. She's painting with bold joyful energy.

[TEXT]
Maya's bedroom looked the same: afternoon light, paint everywhere, music playing softly. But she didn't feel the same. She picked up her brush and opened the magical paint pot. The colors inside shifted and glowed, responding to her boldness. "Okay," she said to her blank paper. "Let's make something wild and true."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 28 (Right) - Transformed by the journey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VISUAL]
Maya paints with fierce joy—bold strokes, mixed colors, energy flying off the page. The painting shows dancers in her own style: wild, authentic, uniquely Maya. Parts of it glow with golden light. Her other paintings on the walls seem brighter. Through the window, a golden thread shimmers. The colorful butterfly from Kathaél rests on the windowsill, watching.

[TEXT]
Maya painted like herself—big bold strokes, colors that clashed and sang, energy that couldn't be contained. Not perfect. Not proper. Just true. Parts of her painting glowed with golden light, the same light she'd brought to Kathaél. Outside her window, a golden thread danced in Madrid sunlight. The butterfly from the meadow sat on her sill, wings brilliant. Maya grinned. "Being yourself," she said, "is the best adventure."
