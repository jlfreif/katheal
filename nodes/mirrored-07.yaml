# Synchrony Arc Position
synchrony_position: 2
synchrony_theme: SHARED DIFFICULTY + PERSISTENCE
synchrony_purpose: |
  Characters face similar struggles apart. The lantern motif shows their
  parallel challenges. Encouragement comes from knowing others persist.

shared_theme_key: almost_success
theme_description: |
  Both characters are close to breakthrough but something holds them back.
  Noah keeps trying to understand the outcome before trusting the process.
  Elise's patient method is working, but the scale overwhelms her.
  A flickering lantern appears in both scenes, responding to trust and honesty.

emotional_beat:
  noah: PROGRESS → SELF-FRUSTRATION
  elise: HOPE → OVERWHELM
  connection: Both characters wonder if the other (from the crossroads) is struggling too

symbolic_motif:
  name: flickering_lantern
  description: A lantern whose flame responds to honesty and trust
  meaning: |
    The lantern embodies the Honesty Rule: it burns bright when characters
    are present without needing to understand everything, dims when they force or doubt.
  visual_details:
    - Flame steadies with trust, sputters with need for comprehension
    - Brightness correlates to emotional honesty
    - Both characters see the same type of lantern in their scenes

scenario_variants:
  - character_code: el
    location: A vast meadow of faded flowers stretching toward distant hills
    challenge_description: |
      Elise's patient attention restores flowers one by one, but the meadow
      seems endless. Each success feels tiny against the overwhelming grey.
      She wonders if her quiet strength really counts.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern hangs from a crooked post, its flame flickering as Elise
      works. When she focuses on one flower with full attention, the flame
      steadies. When she doubts whether her quiet approach matters, it wavers.
    callback_hint: She wonders if the boy she met at the crossroads is having better luck.

  - character_code: no
    location: A grove where story-threads hang frozen, some slowly completing
    challenge_description: |
      Noah has learned that stories complete themselves when he's present
      without understanding everything. But he keeps interfering at the last moment,
      unable to fully trust outcomes he can't predict.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern rests on a stone nearby, its flame responding to his choices.
      When he steps back and trusts without needing to understand, it burns steady.
      When he reaches to analyze or predict the ending, it sputters and dims.
    callback_hint: He hopes the girl at the crossroads is figuring things out too.

spread_alignment: 7

world_connection: |
  This mirrored moment reflects the Presence Rule: progress requires patience
  and trust. Both children are learning that being "almost there" means
  continuing to trust their approach, not abandoning it for quick fixes.
