theme_description: |
  Both characters are close to breakthrough but something holds them back.
  Noah keeps trying to perfect his approach, unable to let go of control.
  Elise's gentle method is working, but the scale overwhelms her.
  A flickering lantern appears in both scenes, responding to their struggles.

symbolic_motif:
  name: flickering_lantern
  description: A lantern whose flame wavers between bright and dim
  meaning: Progress is close but incomplete; trust in the process wavers

scenario_variants:
  - character_code: el
    location: A vast meadow of faded flowers stretching toward distant hills
    challenge_description: |
      Elise's patient attention restores flowers one by one, but the meadow
      seems endless. Each success feels tiny against the overwhelming grey.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern hangs from a crooked post, its flame flickering as Elise
      works. When she focuses on one flower with full attention, the flame
      steadies. When she looks at the endless grey, it wavers.

  - character_code: no
    location: A grove where story-threads hang frozen in tangled clusters
    challenge_description: |
      Noah has learned to let stories complete themselves, but he keeps
      interfering at the last moment, unable to trust the endings will be good enough.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern rests on a stone nearby, its flame responding to his choices.
      When he steps back and trusts, it burns steady. When he reaches to
      revise, it sputters and dims.

  This mirrored moment reflects Kathaél's truth: progress requires patience
  and trust. Both children are learning that being "almost there" means
  continuing to trust their approach, not abandoning it for quick fixes.
