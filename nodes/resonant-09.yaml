# Synchrony Arc Position
synchrony_position: 3
synchrony_theme: MUTUAL BRAVERY + COMMITMENT + EMOTIONAL RESONANCE
synchrony_purpose: |
  Characters' courage ripples across distance. Their brave choices strengthen
  each other through the Heart-Loom. Deep connection without proximity.
  This is the culmination of the synchrony arc: from curiosity (Node 1) through
  shared difficulty (Node 2) to mutual bravery (Node 3).

placement_rule:
  requirement: Must follow a moment of character growth
  verification: |
    At spread 8 (all-is-lost), both characters reached their emotional low.
    Noah realized his need for control was making things worse, but also
    that his presence had kept the stories from fading completely.
    Elise felt overwhelmed by the scale of what needed healing.
    This resonant moment captures their choice to be brave anyway.

emotional_beat:
  noah: SURRENDER → CONNECTION/COURAGE
  elise: DESPAIR → DETERMINATION
  shared: Both feel they're not alone; courage ripples strengthen each other

emotional_state_packets:
  - character_code: el
    emotional_state: quiet determination
    trigger: |
      Elise noticed a single restored flower still glowing from her earlier
      work. One flower mattered. That was enough to start again.
    manifestation: |
      She straightens her shoulders, picks up her watercolor set, and chooses
      to continue—not because she can fix everything, but because each
      flower she helps is real.
    callback: Remembers the fox's lesson about what matters most.

  - character_code: no
    emotional_state: surrendered trust
    trigger: |
      Noah saw that the ruined stories weren't destroyed—they were waiting.
      His control hadn't helped, but his presence had kept them from fading.
      The fox had been right: good isn't the same as right.
    manifestation: |
      He sets down his notebook entirely, opens his hands, and chooses to
      trust the stories without trying to shape them. His surrender is
      its own kind of courage—the courage to imagine something better than
      he could control.
    callback: Integrates the fox's question (Spread 3) and his midpoint insight (Spread 6).

ripple_effects:
  - source_character: el
    target_character: no
    effect: |
      As Elise chooses to continue, Noah—far away in his tangled grove—
      feels an inexplicable warmth. The air around him brightens slightly.
      A story-thread near him trembles, as if encouraged. He thinks of the
      girl at the crossroads.

  - source_character: no
    target_character: el
    effect: |
      As Noah releases his need for control, Elise—in her vast meadow—
      feels the weight on her shoulders lighten. The grey seems less
      oppressive. A flower nearby begins to glow without her touching it.
      She senses she's not alone.

symbolic_resonance:
  phenomenon: golden_thread_shimmer
  description: |
    The Heart-Loom's threads briefly shimmer into visibility across all of
    Kathaél, connecting characters who are making brave choices. This is
    the Courage Rule made visible: when one heart chooses bravely, ripples
    spread through the Heart-Loom, strengthening others.
  manifestation_details:
    - Golden threads appear in the air, pulsing gently
    - Characters see the same shimmer though miles apart
    - The light carries a feeling of connection and hope
    - Both characters sense the other's presence
    - It fades after a moment, leaving warmth and renewed courage behind

world_connection: |
  This resonant moment embodies the Courage Rule: courage creates connection.
  When one heart chooses bravely, the ripple strengthens others who are also
  being brave. Neither child can see the other, but their choices interweave
  in the Heart-Loom. This is the payoff for meeting at the crossroads:
  connection that transcends proximity.
