  verification: |
    At spread 8 (all-is-lost), both characters reached their emotional low.
    Noah realized his need for control was making things worse.
    Elise felt overwhelmed by the scale of what needed healing.
    This resonant moment captures their choice to continue anyway.

emotional_state_packets:
  - character_code: el
    emotional_state: quiet determination
    trigger: |
      Elise noticed a single restored flower still glowing from her earlier
      work. One flower mattered. That was enough to start again.
    manifestation: |
      She straightens her shoulders, picks up her watercolor set, and chooses
      to continue—not because she can fix everything, but because each
      flower she helps is real.

  - character_code: no
    emotional_state: surrendered trust
    trigger: |
      Noah saw that the ruined stories weren't destroyed—they were waiting.
      His control hadn't helped, but his presence had kept them from fading.
    manifestation: |
      He sets down his notebook entirely, opens his hands, and chooses to
      trust the stories without trying to shape them. His surrender is
      its own kind of courage.

    effect: |
      As Elise chooses to continue, Noah—far away in his tangled grove—
      feels an inexplicable warmth. The air around him brightens slightly.
      A story-thread near him trembles, as if encouraged.

  - source_character: no
    target_character: el
    effect: |
      As Noah releases his need for control, Elise—in her vast meadow—
      feels the weight on her shoulders lighten. The grey seems less
      oppressive. A flower nearby begins to glow without her touching it.

  This resonant moment embodies Kathaél's core truth: courage creates
