# Story Improvement Guidelines

**Purpose:** This document tracks specific improvements needed across all six stories. Claude Code should reference this file when making changes to any story content.

**Priority Order:** Critical visual consistency → Story structure → Text transitions → Character-specific fixes

---

## 1. CRITICAL: Visual Consistency Rules

### Text Formatting (EVERY PAGE)
- **Font:** Times New Roman
- **Size:** 16pt
- **Placement:** White space towards the bottom of the page
- **Consistency:** Exact same font and size on every single page across all stories

### Character Visual Consistency (EVERY CHARACTER, EVERY PAGE)
Each character MUST maintain identical visual appearance throughout their entire story:
- [ ] Same age
- [ ] Same haircut
- [ ] Same hair color
- [ ] Same shoes
- [ ] Same clothes

**No exceptions.** Visual character consistency is critical for reader recognition.

### Character Relationships (NO ROMANTIC IMAGERY)
- **Rule:** None of the characters have romantic interests
- **Specific Issue:** Noah's book page 4 - Noah and Elise should NOT be holding hands
- **Apply to:** Review all meeting node pages for accidental romantic framing

---

## 2. Story Structure Changes

### Expand the Climax: Spreads 10-11 (4 Pages Total)

**Current Problem:** Climax occurs only on spread 10 (2 pages) - too brief

**Required Change:**
- **Spread 10 (Pages 10L + 10R):** All six characters come together, heart crystal fights back
- **Spread 11 (Pages 11L + 11R):** Characters apply what they learned in their stories to save the heart crystal
- **Total:** 4 pages of climactic action with all six characters

**Key Elements to Include:**
- Heart crystal actively fights back (show resistance, conflict)
- Each character contributes using skills/lessons from their individual journey
- Action and cooperation among all six characters
- Visual and textual acknowledgment that they are "joining forces to defeat a problem"

### Reduce the Ending: Spread 12 Only (2 Pages Total)

**Current Problem:** Ending spans spreads 11 and 12 (4 pages) - too long after climax resolved

**Required Change:**
- **Spread 12 (Pages 12L + 12R):** Resolution and return home
- Remove/compress content from current spread 11 that is post-resolution

---

## 3. Text & Narrative Improvements

### Transition Text Requirements

**Problem:** Pages before and after meeting nodes are too abrupt. Transitions between pages lack explanation.

**Required:** Text must describe the transition from one page to the next.

**Critical Transition Points:**
- [ ] **Before meeting nodes:** Text should foreshadow/explain how character is moving toward the convergence point
- [ ] **After meeting nodes:** Text should explain how characters separate or continue together
- [ ] **General page-to-page:** Each page's text should bridge to the next scene

**Example Issue to Fix:**
- Noah's story: How is Noah returning to and exiting the library? This must be explained in text.

### Character Recognition at Meeting Nodes

**Family Relationships:** All six characters are siblings or cousins.

**When characters meet, text must show:**
- [ ] Surprise at seeing each other in Kathaél
- [ ] Immediate recognition (they know each other as family)
- [ ] Acknowledgment that they are joining forces to defeat a problem

**Wrong:** Characters meet as strangers and introduce themselves
**Right:** "Noah? What are YOU doing here?" / "I can't believe it's you!" / Recognition + surprise

## 4. Character-Specific Fixes

### Noah's Story

#### Page 5 Right: Remove Random Man
- **Issue:** There is a random man on page 5R with no corresponding text
- **Fix:** Remove the man from the visual, or add text explaining who he is

#### Library Setting: Forest Library
- **Issue:** Library appears as standard indoor library
- **Fix:** Library should be a "forest library" - visually integrated into the forest world of Kathaél
  - Trees as shelves
  - Natural elements integrated with books
  - Outdoor/forest aesthetic maintained
  - Must feel like part of the forest world, not a building

#### Library Transitions
- **Issue:** No explanation of how Noah enters and exits the library
- **Fix:** Add text describing:
  - How Noah discovers/enters the library
  - How Noah exits the library
  - Physical transition between forest and library space

### Elise's Story

#### Dance Style Correction
- **Issue:** May be visually depicted as ballet
- **Fix:** Elise dances pop and hip-hop, NOT ballet
  - Clothing: streetwear, sneakers, casual dance attire
  - Poses: hip-hop and pop dance movements
  - Setting: contemporary dance context, not classical ballet studio

---

## 5. Writing Style Clarification

### PRIMARY STYLE: "Where the Wild Things Are"

**IMPORTANT:** The detailed `WRITING_STYLE.md` is supplementary guidance.

**The PRIMARY writing style should resemble "Where the Wild Things Are" by Maurice Sendak:**

#### Characteristics of "Where the Wild Things Are" Style:
- **Brevity:** Short, punchy sentences
- **Simplicity:** Clear, direct language
- **Rhythm:** Lyrical, read-aloud quality
- **Repetition:** Repeated phrases for emphasis and rhythm
- **Child's Perspective:** Imaginative, immediate, emotional
- **Sparse Text:** Let illustrations carry much of the story
- **Poetic Phrasing:** "And Max said 'BE STILL!'"
- **Adventure Focus:** External action over internal contemplation

#### Key Differences from Detailed Writing Guide:
- **Shorter sentences:** More like Sendak, less elaborate description
- **More white space:** Fewer words per page
- **Rhythmic flow:** Prioritize read-aloud rhythm over varied sentence structure
- **Simpler vocabulary:** Age 8-12 but skewing younger in sentence complexity
- **Direct emotion:** "He was angry" is OK in this style (Sendak uses direct emotion)

**When in conflict, "Where the Wild Things Are" style wins.**
