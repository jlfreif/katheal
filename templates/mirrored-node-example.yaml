# Mirrored Node Template
#
# A Mirrored Node represents characters facing parallel challenges in
# DIFFERENT places, where themes intentionally "rhyme" across their stories.
#
# CHARACTERISTICS:
#   - Characters are in DIFFERENT locations
#   - They face parallel/similar challenges
#   - A symbolic motif appears in ALL connected stories
#   - Strict spread alignment across books (same spread number)
#   - Themes resonate without physical connection
#
# FILE NAMING:
#   - Each character has their OWN page file: el-05.yaml, no-05.yaml
#   - The spread number is the same for all characters
#   - A mirrored-node definition file links them: mirrored-05.yaml
#
# CONSTRAINTS:
#   - Cannot occur on spreads 1, 11, or 12 (must be character-specific)
#   - Valid spreads: 2-10
#   - Characters must NOT be in the same location

# This is a DEFINITION file that links mirrored pages across characters
# Individual character pages remain separate but reference this definition

# Mirrored node identification
id: mirrored-05
spread: 5
node_type: mirrored

# Story beat (same for all connected characters at this spread)
beat: "Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)"

# The shared thematic element that connects all scenes
shared_theme_key: facing_the_unfamiliar

# Theme description
theme_description: |
  Each character ventures into unfamiliar territory and encounters something
  that challenges their assumptions. The world is bigger than they thought,
  and simple answers won't work here.

# Symbolic motif - object/symbol that appears in ALL stories at this spread
symbolic_motif:
  name: flickering_lantern
  description: A lantern whose flame wavers between bright and dim, symbolizing uncertainty
  meaning: The light of guidance is present but not constant; trust must be earned

# Scenario variants - how each character experiences the mirrored theme
scenario_variants:
  - character_code: el
    location: A mist-shrouded grove where the trees seem to shift when not watched
    challenge_description: |
      Elise enters a part of the forest where paths seem to change behind her.
      She meets a fox-like creature who speaks in riddles and offers help
      that seems suspicious.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern hangs from a low branch, its flame flickering uncertainly.
      Elise watches it waver as the fox speaks, noticing the flame dims
      when the creature says something that doesn't feel true.

  - character_code: no
    location: An ancient bridge spanning a chasm filled with swirling clouds
    challenge_description: |
      Noah reaches a bridge that looks solid but feels unstable. A crow
      perched on the railing assures him the bridge is safe, but its
      voice carries an edge of mockery.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern at the bridge's entrance flickers in the wind. Noah notices
      its flame grows steady when he trusts his own judgment, and wavers
      when he listens to the crow's confident assurances.

# Spread alignment verification
spread_alignment: 5

# Connection to world themes
world_connection: |
  This mirrored moment reflects Kathaél's nature: the world responds to
  sincerity and honest choice. Both children are learning that not all
  help is helpful, and that their own instincts matter.
