    visual: |
      A crossroads in Kathaél where multiple forest paths meet beneath an ancient willow
      tree whose branches glow softly with golden threads from the Heart Crystal. Noah (12
      years old, sandy blond hair, medium build) stands on the left path, one hand extended
      toward a shimmering thread that hovers in the air at eye level, his expression
      focused and curious. Elise (9 years old, slim, graceful) stands on the right path,
      her head tilted as she observes a different glowing thread, her hand raised gently
      as if about to touch it. Between them, the threads weave and intersect in midair,
      creating a soft lattice of golden light. The ground is soft moss with small
      luminescent mushrooms dotting the edges of each path.

      At the crossroads where forest paths met, Noah noticed golden threads floating
      in the air like gentle streams of light. Elise stood nearby, watching the same
      threads dance between the willow branches. Neither had expected to find someone
      else seeking answers in this quiet place.

  # Right page (second scene of the beat)
  - page: right
    page_number: 12
    focus: Receiving direction with warning
    visual: |
      The willow's drooping branches frame Noah and Elise as they stand closer together
      now, both reaching toward where the golden threads converge into a bright point
      of light. The threads pulse gently, as if responding to their presence. Small
      particles of light drift through the air like fireflies. The morning mist rolls
      through the background forest, and the atmosphere is hushed and reverent. Both
      children look at each other with recognition - not yet friends, but aware they
      share the same journey.
    text: |
      The threads seemed to understand what they needed, weaving together into a path
      that pointed deeper into the forest. "I think it wants us to follow," Elise
      whispered. Noah nodded slowly, feeling the pull of something important ahead,
      though neither knew what waited beyond the mist.
