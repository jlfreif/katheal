meta:
  target_audience: "Children ages 9-12"
  reading_level: "Independent readers or read-aloud by parents"
  tone: "Curious, active, adventurous - not anxious or overly introspective. Keep the overall tone light and fun. Include moments of humor and playfulness. Characters can have funny reactions to magical situations. Age-appropriate silly moments (physical comedy, wordplay, funny observations). Balance adventure stakes with comedic relief."

text_formatting:
  font: "Times New Roman"
  size: "16pt"
  placement: "White space towards the bottom of the page"
  consistency: "CRITICAL - Exact same font and size on EVERY page across ALL stories"

character_relationships:
  family_structure: "All six characters are siblings or cousins"
  recognition: |
    When characters meet at nodes:
    - They recognize each other immediately (family members)
    - Express surprise at seeing each other in Kathaél
    - Acknowledge joining forces to defeat the problem
  visual_rules:
    - "NO romantic imagery between any characters"
    - "Each character retains same visual appearance on every page (age, haircut, hair color, shoes, clothes)"

transition_requirements:
  page_to_page: "Text must describe transition from one page to the next"
  meeting_nodes: |
    CRITICAL: Pages before and after meeting nodes require transition text explaining:
    - How character approaches the meeting location
    - How character departs or continues after the meeting

world_building:
  central_object: "Heart Crystal"
  description: "Massive crystalline structure, 6 facets, physically interactive"
  note: "NOT Heart-Loom. Use crystal/prism/facet language, not tapestry/weaving/loom"

writing_principles:
  primary_style: |
    PRIMARY WRITING STYLE: "Where the Wild Things Are" by Maurice Sendak
    - Brevity: Short, punchy sentences
    - Simplicity: Clear, direct language
    - Rhythm: Lyrical, read-aloud quality with repetition for emphasis
    - Child's perspective: Imaginative, immediate, emotional
    - Sparse text: Let illustrations carry much of the story
    - Poetic phrasing: Direct and memorable
    - Adventure focus: External action over internal contemplation

    WRITING_STYLE.md is supplementary. When in conflict, Sendak style wins.

  action_vs_introspection: "80% external action and sensory / 20% internal reaction"
  primary_focus:
    - "Show characters DOING things (running, climbing, chasing)"
    - "Include sensory details in every scene (sounds, textures, temperatures)"
    - "Give creatures active roles (guides, helpers, obstacles)"
    - "Show visible consequences when things go wrong"
    - "Use dialogue and interaction over contemplation"
    - "incorporate humor and some sillyness"

  avoid:
    - "Excessive internal monologue or anxiety language"
    - "Self-critical loops (why do I keep...)"
    - "Heavy philosophical introspection"
    - "Passive observation without participation"
    - "Abstract stakes that kids can't visualize"

language_patterns:
  use_frequently:
    verbs: ["darted", "lunged", "dove", "caught", "spun", "burst", "reached", "grabbed"]
    sensory: ["warm", "cold", "tingly", "rough", "hummed", "chimed", "glowing", "shimmering"]
    reactions: ["gasped", "laughed", "grinned", "eyes widened", "breath caught"]

  use_sparingly:
    anxiety: ["stomach tightened", "cheeks burning"]
    emotion: ["voice cracked"]
    self_criticism: ["why do I keep", "I always"]

scene_structure:
  each_spread_should_include:
    - "Physical movement or action"
    - "Sensory details (minimum 2 senses per spread)"
    - "External event that advances plot"
    - "Brief character reaction leading to next action"
    - "Dialogue or creature interaction"

  read_aloud_test:
    - "Flows naturally when read by parent"
    - "Holds attention of 9-year-old"
    - "Includes moments of wonder or excitement"
    - "Not heavy or overly serious"

#
# This template maps out a complete story arc across 12 spreads (24 pages).
# Each spread contains 2 pages, and each page contains 1 scene with:
#   - 1 image per page (2 images per spread)
#   - 2-3 sentences per scene
#   - Each story beat is expressed over two scenes (left page + right page)
#
# Based on classic story structure: setup, rising action, midpoint,
# crisis, climax, and resolution.
#
# LAYOUT SYSTEM:
#   - 12 spreads total
#   - 2 pages per spread (left page + right page)
#   - 1 image per page
#   - 2-3 sentences per scene
#   - Each story beat spans both pages of a spread
#
# NODE TYPES:
#   Narrative nodes connect character stories at synchronized points.
#   Three types of nodes can occur at any spread (except 1, 11, 12):
#
#   1. MEETING NODE - Characters physically converge
#      - Same location, same time
#      - Shared action between characters
#      - Cross-book image alignment (same scene, POV variants)
#
#   2. MIRRORED NODE - Parallel challenges, themes "rhyme"
#      - Different locations, shared theme
#      - Symbolic motif appears in all stories
#      - Strict spread alignment across books
#
#   3. RESONANT NODE - Emotional/energetic ripple across distance
#      - Emotional connection without physical proximity
#      - One character's shift affects another's world
#      - Must follow a moment of character growth
