# Spread Template
#
# LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
# - Each spread contains 2 pages (left and right facing pages when book is open)
# - Each spread contains 1 image total (spanning across both pages)
# - Each spread contains 2-3 sentences of text
# - File naming: {char-code}-{spread}.yaml (e.g., cu-03.yaml)
# - For shared spreads: {char1}-{char2}-{spread}.yaml (alphabetical order, e.g., cu-ma-03.yaml)
#
# Eventually, we will create a custom /command that can create
# a bunch of spreads all at once.

# Should be equal to the name of the file
# This means "Cullan spread 3"
id: cu-03 # The name of the file

# See `templates/story-template.yaml` for documentation
# Should match the ID and the filename
spread: 3

# Node type for this spread (solo, meeting, mirrored, resonant)
# See templates/story-template.yaml for allowed node types per spread
node_type: solo

# This is an ultra-short description of where we are in the story.
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
beat: "Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)"

# This is what "hooks them" into the next spread
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
hook: Simple solutions fail, prompting the question of who might have better answers.

# This is the payoff from the previous spread's hook
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
payoff: A wise helper appears who offers new perspective or guidance.

# This is a short (1-2 sentences) which describes what you see on the spread.
description: Cullan tries to climb up the ladder but finds it too slippery and falls.

# The visual description can be very long and detailed to convey the scene
# IMPORTANT: Describe a SINGLE INSTANT IN TIME - not a sequence of actions
# - Describe WHAT is happening at this exact moment (the action, poses, expressions)
# - Describe WHERE things are (positions, spatial relationships, background details)
# - Include specific visual details about the world, objects, and environment
# - Do NOT include stylistic suggestions (those come from world.yaml)
# - Do NOT describe multiple moments or a sequence of events
# - This single image will span across both pages of the spread
visual: |
  Cullan is mid-slip, falling backwards off the wooden ladder propped against a massive
  oak tree. His body is angled diagonally, arms spread wide, eyes wide with surprise,
  mouth open in shock. The ladder tilts dangerously against the tree trunk, its rungs
  clearly too slick with morning dew to grip. His feet have lost contact completely.
  Around him on the mossy forest floor lie scattered tools: a coil of rope, a small
  hammer, and a leather pouch. The forest surrounds them - tall trees with thick trunks,
  dense undergrowth of ferns. Morning light filters through the canopy creating dappled
  shadows. Mushrooms grow at the base of nearby trees. The perspective captures the
  moment of failure - the instant when his confident plan goes wrong.

# Text for this spread
# IMPORTANT: Keep text to 2-3 sentences. Be concise but complete.

  Cullan had a plan: climb the old oak tree and reach the bird's nest at the top.
  But the first rung was slippery with dew, and his foot slid off. Before he could
  catch himself, he was falling backwards toward the ground.
