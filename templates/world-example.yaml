# World Example
#
# This file serves as both an example and a schema for creating your world.
# When creating a new world, ask the user questions based on each field below,
# then fill in their answers in world.yaml

# What's this world called?
name: Fantasia

# What's the visual style?
# How does this world look? What's the aesthetic, color palette, atmosphere?
# This is used for prompting the visual system.
visual_style:
  - Fine pen and ink style, with dream-like watercolor overlays.
  - The world is a forest, but very wet, with waterfalls and streams everywhere.
  - There are lots of magical creatures and details everywhere, mushrooms, small mammals, and strange creatures in the trees.
  - Everything has a gentle glow, as if lit by unseen magical source

# === CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS (CRITICAL) ===
#
# Define how characters relate to each other.
# For this project: All six characters are siblings or cousins (family members).
#
# This affects:
#   - How characters interact at Narrative Nodes (immediate recognition, surprise at meeting)
#   - Dialogue and emotional reactions (family dynamics)
#   - Visual constraints (NO romantic imagery between characters)
#   - Character consistency (each maintains same appearance across all pages)
#
family_relationships:
  structure: "All six characters are siblings or cousins"
  recognition_rules:
    - "Characters immediately recognize each other when they meet"
    - "Express surprise at encountering family in this magical world"
    - "Acknowledge joining forces to solve problems together"
    - "NO romantic undertones or imagery between any characters"
  visual_consistency:
    - "Each character maintains identical appearance across all pages"
    - "Same age, haircut, hair color, clothing, and shoes throughout"
    - "Critical for cross-story character recognition"
