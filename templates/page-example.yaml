# Page Template
#
# Each page file represents one SPREAD (2 facing pages) in the storybook.
# The spread contains 2 scenes, one per page:
#   - Left page (odd page number): First scene of the story beat
#   - Right page (even page number): Second scene of the story beat
#
# LAYOUT SYSTEM:
#   - 1 image per page (2 images per spread)
#   - 3-4 sentences per scene
#   - Each story beat is expressed over both pages
#
# TEXT FORMATTING (CRITICAL):
#   - Font: Times New Roman, 16pt
#   - Placement: White space towards bottom of page
#   - Consistency: MUST be exact same on every page
#
# TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
#   - Text must describe transition from one page to next
#   - Pages before/after meeting nodes need clear entry/exit explanations
#
# VISUAL CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL):
#   - Characters retain same appearance on EVERY page (age, hair, clothes, shoes)
#   - NO romantic imagery between characters (all are family)
#
# FILE NAMING:
#   - Solo pages: cc-pp.yaml (e.g., cu-03.yaml)
#   - Shared pages: cc-cc-pp.yaml alphabetically (e.g., cu-ma-07.yaml)

# Should be equal to the name of the file
# This means "Cullan spread 3"
id: cu-03

# See `templates/story-template.yaml` for documentation
# Should match the ID and the filename
spread: 3

# Node type: solo, meeting, mirrored, or resonant
# For solo pages, omit or set to "solo"
# For shared/connected pages, specify the node type
node_type: solo

# This is an ultra-short description of where we are in the story.
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
beat: "Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)"

# This is what "hooks them" into the next pages
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
hook: Simple solutions fail, prompting the question of who might have better answers.

# This is the payoff from the previous spread's hook
# Initially, copy this from `templates/story-template.yaml` for this spread
payoff: A wise helper appears who offers new perspective or guidance.

# This is a short (1-2 sentences) which describes the overall spread action
description: Cullan tries to climb up the ladder but finds it too slippery, then realizes he needs a different approach.

# === SCENE-BASED STRUCTURE ===
# Each spread contains 2 scenes (one per page)
# Each scene has its own visual and text

scenes:
  # Left page - First scene of the beat
  - page: left
    page_number: 9
    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    # Visual description for this scene
    # IMPORTANT: Describe a SINGLE INSTANT IN TIME - not a sequence of actions
    # - Describe WHAT is happening at this exact moment (the action, poses, expressions)
    # - Describe WHERE things are (positions, spatial relationships, background details)
    # - Include specific visual details about the world, objects, and environment
    # - Do NOT include stylistic suggestions (those come from world.yaml)
    # - Do NOT describe multiple moments or a sequence of events

      Cullan is mid-slip, falling backwards off a wooden ladder. His body is angled
      diagonally, arms spread wide, eyes wide with surprise, mouth open. The ladder
      is propped against a massive oak tree, its rungs slick with moisture. Below
      him on the mossy ground lie scattered tools: a coil of rope, a small hammer,
      and a leather pouch. The forest surrounds them - tall trees with thick trunks,
      dense undergrowth of ferns, and a small stream visible in the mid-ground.
      Morning light filters through the canopy creating dappled shadows on the
      forest floor. Mushrooms grow at the base of nearby trees.

    # Story text for this page
    # IMPORTANT: 3-4 sentences that advance the story
    text: |
      Cullan found an old ladder leaning against the great oak and thought his
      problem was solved. He placed his foot on the first rung, then the second,
      feeling quite clever about his plan. But the wood was slick with morning
      dew, and before he could grab hold, his feet shot out from under him.

  # Right page - Second scene of the beat
  - page: right
    page_number: 10
    focus: Realizing it doesn't work

    visual: |
      Cullan sits on the mossy ground, rubbing his elbow where he landed. The
      ladder lies flat beside him, one rung cracked from the fall. His expression
      is frustrated but thoughtful, brow furrowed as he looks up at the oak tree's
      branches high above. Around him, the forest seems to watch - a squirrel
      pauses on a nearby branch, a robin tilts its head from a low bush. The
      morning mist is beginning to lift, revealing more of the forest's depth.
      Golden light catches on dewdrops scattered across the ferns.

      Cullan rubbed his sore elbow and stared up at the branches that seemed
      impossibly far away. The ladder was useless now, with its cracked rung
      and slippery surface. He needed a better idea, but where would he find
      one? Maybe someone in this forest knew secrets about climbing that he didn't.
