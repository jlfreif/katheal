# Resonant Node Template
#
# A Resonant Node represents an emotional or energetic ripple that connects
# characters across distance. One character's emotional shift creates a
# subtle effect in another character's world.
#
# CHARACTERISTICS:
#   - Characters are NOT physically together
#   - Emotional/energetic connection across distance
#   - One character's growth moment affects another's environment
#   - Symbolic phenomenon visible in both scenes (sky shimmer, lantern glow, etc.)
#   - MUST follow a moment of character growth
#
# FILE NAMING:
#   - Each character has their OWN page file: el-09.yaml, no-09.yaml
#   - The spread number is the same for all characters
#   - A resonant-node definition file links them: resonant-09.yaml
#
# CONSTRAINTS:
#   - Cannot occur on spreads 1, 11, or 12 (must be character-specific)
#   - Valid spreads: 2-10
#   - MUST be placed after a character growth moment
#   - Characters must NOT be in the same location

# This is a DEFINITION file that links resonant pages across characters
# Individual character pages remain separate but reference this definition

    At spread 8 (all-is-lost), both characters reached their emotional low.
    This resonant moment at spread 9 captures their choice to continue,
    and their emotional shifts ripple across to each other's worlds.

# Emotional state packets - per character
emotional_state_packets:
  - character_code: el
    emotional_state: quiet determination
    trigger: |
      Elise remembered why she started this journey - not for herself,
      but because something needed her help. That memory rekindled her resolve.
    manifestation: |
      Her posture straightens, her eyes clear. She takes a deep breath
      and places her hand on her heart, feeling a warmth spread through her.

  - character_code: no
    emotional_state: renewed courage
    trigger: |
      Noah realized that giving up would mean abandoning something important.
      The fear was still there, but it no longer had the final word.
    manifestation: |
      His jaw sets with determination. He looks at the path ahead with
      new eyes, seeing possibility where before he saw only obstacle.

# Ripple effect - how one character's shift affects another's world
ripple_effects:
  - source_character: el
    target_character: no
    effect: |
      As Elise's determination solidifies, Noah - miles away on his own path -
      feels an inexplicable warmth, as if someone believes in him. The air
      around him seems to brighten slightly.

  - source_character: no
    target_character: el
    effect: |
      As Noah's courage returns, Elise - in her distant grove - notices
      the shadows seem less deep. A gentle breeze carries something that
      feels like encouragement, though she couldn't say from where.

# Symbolic resonance phenomenon
symbolic_resonance:
  phenomenon: golden_thread_shimmer
  description: |
    The Heart-Loom's threads, usually invisible, briefly shimmer into
    visibility across Kathaél. Characters far apart see the same golden
    light pulse through the air, connecting their moments of choice.
  manifestation_details:
    - Golden threads appear in the air, pulsing gently
    - The light is warm and reassuring
    - It fades after a few heartbeats, leaving a sense of connection
    - Characters may not understand what happened, but they feel less alone

# Connection to world themes
world_connection: |
  This resonant moment embodies Kathaél's core truth: heartfelt choices
  create glowing threads in the Heart-Loom, and those threads connect
  all who make brave decisions. Even without knowing each other,
  characters strengthen each other through their courage.
