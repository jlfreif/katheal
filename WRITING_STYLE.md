# Writing Style Guide

## 1. Target Audience Specifications

### Demographics
- **Age Range:** 8-12 years old (middle grade readers)
- **Reading Level:** Lexile 600-850 (grades 3-6)
- **Format:** Children's storybook with illustrations 
- **Tone:** Warm, adventurous, humorous, silly,

### Key Considerations
- Accessible vocabulary with occasional "stretch" words in context
- Emotional depth that respects young readers' intelligence
- Fast-paced plotting with meaningful character moments
- Age-appropriate stakes (friendship, family, self-discovery, adventure)
- Tone guidance: "Stories should be lighthearted and fun"
- Humor examples: "Include age-appropriate jokes, funny mishaps, playful banter"
- Comedy beats: "Characters can have humorous reactions or make silly mistakes"

---

## 2. Age 9-12 Action & Sensory Writing Principles

### Target Tone for Ages 9-12
- **Curious and Active**: Characters explore, experiment, move constantly
- **Adventurous**: Physical challenges and external obstacles
- **Age-Appropriate**: Smart vocabulary without condescension
- **Encouraging**: Characters learn through action, not harsh self-criticism
- **Sensory-Rich**: Appeal to all five senses in every scene
  Tone guidance: "Stories should be lighthearted and fun"

### Writing Balance Formula
**Target ratio: 80% external action/sensory / 20% internal reaction**

Each spread (2 pages) should include:
- **Physical movement** - Character going somewhere or doing something
- **Sensory detail** - What it looks/sounds/feels/smells like
- **External event** - Something happens in the world
- **Character reaction** - Brief, focused on decision or next action
- **Dialogue or interaction** - With creatures, environment, or other characters

### DO (increase these elements)
✅ **Show action and movement** - Characters running, climbing, chasing, dodging
✅ **Use sensory details** - Sounds (chimes, hums, cracks), textures (warm, tingly, rough), smells
✅ **Active creatures** - Animals guide, help, create obstacles, react - not just observe
✅ **Visible consequences** - When magic fails, show what happens (flowers die, colors fade, birds go silent)
✅ **Physical reactions** - Gasping, laughing, jumping - not just internal feelings
✅ **Dialogue and interaction** - Characters talk with creatures and each other
✅ **Immediate stakes** - Readers can SEE and UNDERSTAND what's at risk
✅ **Learning through doing** - Characters figure things out by trying, not contemplating
- Humor: "Include age-appropriate jokes, funny mishaps, playful banter"

### DON'T (reduce these elements)
❌ **Excessive internal monologue** - Limit to brief moments; prioritize external action
❌ **Repeated anxiety language** - Avoid overusing "stomach tightened," "cheeks burning"
❌ **Self-critical loops** - Characters shouldn't dwell on their failures harshly
❌ **Heavy philosophical introspection** - Keep it light and action-oriented and witty
❌ **Passive observation** - Characters should participate, not just watch
❌ **Abstract stakes** - Make consequences visible and concrete
❌ **Static scenes** - Something should always be moving or changing

### Active Verbs (use frequently)
darted, lunged, dove, caught, spun, burst, reached, grabbed, climbed, ran, jumped, gasped, laughed, shouted, called, pressed, touched, pulled, pushed, dodged, chased, explored, examined

### Sensory Words (use frequently)
**Touch**: warm, cold, tingly, rough, smooth, soft, sharp, gentle
**Sound**: hummed, chimed, cracked, rustled, whispered, sang, clinked, snapped
**Sight**: glowing, shimmering, pulsing, flickering, blazing, sparking, fading, brightening
**Smell**: (use sparingly but memorably)
**Taste**: (rare but powerful when used)

### Avoid Overusing
- "stomach tightened" (anxiety) - use max 1-2 times per story
- "cheeks burning" (shame) - use sparingly
- "voice cracked" (emotion) - save for climactic moments only
- "why do I keep..." (self-criticism) - replace with forward-looking questions
- Long paragraphs without action or dialogue

### Scene Structure Best Practices

#### Each Scene Should Include:
1. **Opening**: Physical action or movement
2. **Middle**: Sensory details + external event
3. **End**: Brief reaction leading to next action

#### Good Scene Example:
```
Noah darted between the trees, golden threads humming around him. He grabbed
one—it felt warm, almost alive. The thread pulsed under his fingers, and
words appeared in the air: "She opened the door and..." then nothing.
"Come on," he whispered. "What happens next?"
```

#### Why This Works:
- Physical action (darted, grabbed)
- Sensory details (humming, warm, pulsed)
- External event (words appeared)
- Dialogue instead of introspection
- Something is always happening

### Character Development Through Action
Characters should:
- Make mistakes and learn from doing (not from introspection alone)
- Show courage through action (not just deciding to be brave)
- Interact with their environment constantly
- Have physical reactions to emotional moments
- Grow through experience and experimentation
- Face external obstacles more than internal ones (60/40 ratio)
- Engage in humor
  
### Magic and Fantasy Elements
Magic in Kathaél should be:
- **Visible** - Lights, colors, sparks, glows
- **Audible** - Chimes, hums, musical notes, cracks
- **Tactile** - Warm, cold, tingly, rough, smooth
- **Active** - Moves, flows, responds, reacts to characters
- **Consequential** - Has visible effects when it works or fails

### Read-Aloud Test
Every scene should:
- Flow naturally when read aloud by a parent
- Hold the attention of a 9-year-old listener
- Not feel heavy, preachy, or overly serious
- Include moments of wonder, humor, excitement, or surprise
- Use rhythm and pacing that matches the action

## 3. Core "Show Don't Tell" Principles

**Never state emotions directly. Always reveal them through physical sensations, actions, and sensory details.**

### Before/After Examples

#### Example 1: Fear
❌ **Before (Telling):** Maya was scared of the dark forest.

✅ **After (Showing):** Maya's breath caught in her throat. The trees pressed closer with each step, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching for her hair. She wiped her palms on her jeans, but they were slick again within seconds.

#### Example 2: Excitement
❌ **Before (Telling):** Alex was excited about the discovery.

✅ **After (Showing):** Alex bounced on his toes, unable to stand still. The words tumbled out faster than he could catch them. "Did you see? Did you see that? It actually worked!"

#### Example 3: Sadness
❌ **Before (Telling):** She felt sad when her friend left.

✅ **After (Showing):** Lia traced patterns in the dust on the windowsill, watching the moving truck grow smaller down the street. The house suddenly felt too big, too quiet, too full of empty spaces.

#### Example 4: Anger
❌ **Before (Telling):** Marcus was angry at his brother.

✅ **After (Showing):** Marcus's jaw clenched so tight his teeth ached. He shoved his hands deep in his pockets to keep from throwing something. "Fine," he bit out, each word sharp as glass. "Whatever."

#### Example 5: Nervousness
❌ **Before (Telling):** She was nervous about the presentation.

✅ **After (Showing):** Kai's stomach twisted itself into knots. She shuffled her note cards for the third time, even though she'd memorized every word. The classroom door loomed ahead like the entrance to a cave.

#### Example 6: Joy
❌ **Before (Telling):** They were happy to be together again.

✅ **After (Showing):** Leo crashed into his sister with a hug that nearly knocked them both over. They were laughing and talking over each other, hands gesturing wildly, finishing each other's sentences the way they always had.

#### Example 7: Confusion
❌ **Before (Telling):** Sam was confused by the strange symbols.

✅ **After (Showing):** Sam tilted the page sideways, then upside down. The symbols swirled and shifted, never quite making sense. She rubbed her eyes, but the headache gathering behind them only got worse.

## 3. Sentence Structure Variation

**Mix sentence lengths and structures to create rhythm and maintain reader engagement.**

### Types of Sentences

#### Short, Punchy (1-5 words)
- Creates urgency and impact
- Breaks up longer passages
- Emphasizes important moments

**Examples:**
- She ran.
- The door slammed shut.
- Too late.
- Now or never.

#### Compound (Two independent clauses)
- Connects related ideas
- Creates flow and balance

**Examples:**
- The wind howled through the trees, and Maya pulled her jacket tighter.
- Alex reached for the book, but his fingers passed right through it.

#### Complex (Independent + dependent clauses)
- Adds depth and nuance
- Shows cause and effect
- Builds tension

**Examples:**
- When the clock struck midnight, everything changed.
- She held her breath as the footsteps grew closer.
- Because she'd practiced every day for a month, the spell finally worked.

#### Fragments (For emphasis and voice)
- Mimics natural thought patterns
- Creates punch and personality
- Use sparingly

**Examples:**
- Not good. Not good at all.
- Too many questions. Not enough answers.
- Magic. Real, actual magic.

#### Questions (Engages reader thinking)
- Raises stakes
- Shows character uncertainty
- Draws readers deeper

**Examples:**
- What had she just done?
- How could something so small hold so much power?
- Was this really happening, or had she finally lost her mind?

### Example Paragraph with Good Variation

Maya pressed her ear against the door. Silence. She counted to ten, then twenty, her heart hammering against her ribs. Should she risk it? The hallway beyond could be empty, or it could be crawling with guards. No way to know except to open the door and find out. She wrapped her fingers around the cold brass handle. Three deep breaths. Then she turned it, wincing at the soft click that sounded loud as a gunshot in the quiet. The door swung open. Empty. She nearly laughed with relief, but then she heard it: footsteps, echoing from somewhere close. Too close.

---

## 4. Active Voice Principles

**Use active voice to create dynamic, engaging prose. Reserve passive voice for specific effects (when the actor is unknown or irrelevant).**

### Weak Passive vs. Strong Active

| ❌ Passive (Weak) | ✅ Active (Strong) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| The spell was cast by Maya. | Maya cast the spell. |
| The door was opened by the wind. | The wind tore the door open. |
| Mistakes were made. | She messed up. Bad. |
| The truth was finally discovered. | Alex uncovered the truth. |
| The monster was feared by everyone. | Everyone feared the monster. |
| A sound was heard in the darkness. | Something moved in the darkness. |

### Replace Generic Verbs with Vivid, Specific Ones

#### Instead of "Walked"
- trudged, stomped, tiptoed, strode, shuffled, crept, marched, wandered, staggered, strutted, limped, bounded, slunk, meandered, prowled

#### Instead of "Said"
- whispered, muttered, shouted, hissed, murmured, declared, announced, breathed, snapped, blurted, stammered, groaned, chirped, grumbled, insisted

#### Instead of "Looked"
- stared, glanced, peered, squinted, glimpsed, studied, scanned, examined, inspected, surveyed, watched, observed, gaped, glared

#### Instead of "Went"
- hurried, rushed, darted, dashed, sprinted, fled, ventured, journeyed, traveled, approached, departed, advanced, retreated

#### Instead of "Got"
- grabbed, snatched, seized, obtained, acquired, received, earned, claimed, caught, retrieved, collected

#### Instead of "Was/Were" (when describing action)
- seemed, appeared, looked, felt, acted, remained, stood, sat, became, grew

---

## 5. Concrete Sensory Language

**Ground abstract concepts in physical, sensory reality. Make readers see, hear, feel, smell, and taste the story.**

### Abstract vs. Concrete

| ❌ Abstract | ✅ Concrete |
|------------|------------|
| The place was old. | Dust coated every surface. The floorboards groaned with each step, and the air smelled like old books and mothballs. |
| Magic filled the room. | Blue sparks danced across her fingertips, crackling like tiny fireworks. The air tasted like copper and electricity. |
| Time passed slowly. | Each second stretched like taffy. The clock's ticking thundered in her ears: tick, tick, tick. |
| She felt different. | Her skin buzzed like she'd touched a live wire. Everything looked sharper, brighter, more real than it had minutes before. |
| The forest was mysterious. | Shadows pooled between the ancient trees. Something rustled in the undergrowth, too big to be a squirrel, too quiet to be a deer. The deeper she walked, the darker it grew, even though the sun still hung high overhead. |

### Sensory Details Checklist

- [ ] **Sight:** Colors, movement, light/shadow, shapes, textures
- [ ] **Sound:** Volume, pitch, rhythm, echoes, silence
- [ ] **Touch:** Temperature, texture, pressure, pain, comfort
- [ ] **Smell:** Fresh, stale, sharp, sweet, musty, chemical
- [ ] **Taste:** Sweet, sour, bitter, metallic, earthy

### Grounding Emotional Moments

**Always anchor emotions in the body and environment.**

| Emotion | Physical Grounding |
|---------|-------------------|
| Fear | Cold sweat, shallow breathing, racing heart, trembling hands, dry mouth |
| Excitement | Tingling skin, can't sit still, talking fast, smiling uncontrollably, warm chest |
| Sadness | Heavy limbs, tight throat, burning eyes, empty stomach, everything moves slower |
| Anger | Hot face, clenched fists, grinding teeth, tense shoulders, sharp voice |
| Nervousness | Fluttering stomach, fidgeting hands, stumbling words, avoiding eye contact, false confidence |

## 6. Natural Dialogue Rules

**Write dialogue that sounds like real kids talking, not miniature adults.**

### Key Principles

- Kids interrupt themselves and each other
- They use contractions (don't, can't, won't, I'm, we're)
- They speak in fragments and run-ons when excited
- They use age-appropriate slang (but avoid trendy terms that will date the text)
- They say "um," "like," "you know," and "I mean" occasionally (but not excessively)
- They ask questions constantly
- They make logical leaps that make sense to them

### Before/After Examples

#### Example 1: Too Formal
❌ **Before:** "I must inform you that I believe your hypothesis regarding the magical artifact is incorrect. Perhaps we should reconsider our approach to this problem."

✅ **After:** "Wait, I think you've got it backwards. What if we tried it the other way around?"

#### Example 2: Too Stilted
❌ **Before:** "Good morning, Marcus. Did you sleep well? I had quite an interesting dream last evening."

✅ **After:** "Marcus! Dude, you won't believe the dream I had. It was so weird."

#### Example 3: Natural Flow
✅ **Good Example:**
"But what if it doesn't work?"
"Then we try something else. Come on, we've got to at least try."
"I know, I know. It's just... what if we make things worse?"
"Worse than this? Not possible."

#### Example 4: Authentic Kid Voice
✅ **Good Example:**
"You're not actually going in there, are you?"
"Why not?"
"Um, because it's creepy and dark and probably full of spiders?"
"So?"
"So I'm not going in there. No way. Not happening."
"Fine. Stay here then. I'll be right back."
"Wait! I didn't say I wasn't coming. I just said it's creepy. Ugh, I hate you sometimes."

### Dialogue Tags

**Use "said" and "asked" 90% of the time. They're invisible to readers.**

- Occasionally use: whispered, shouted, muttered, called, yelled
- Avoid: exclaimed, pontificated, declared, ejaculated, queried
- Better than fancy tags: action beats

**Example with Action Beats:**
"We need to go. Now." Alex grabbed his backpack.
Maya didn't move. "What about the others?"
"There's no time." He was already at the door. "Maya, please."

---

## 7. "Trust Your Reader" Principles

**Middle grade readers are smart. Don't over-explain or spell out every emotion and connection.**

### Over-Explained vs. Appropriately Subtle

#### Example 1: Emotional Subtext
❌ **Over-Explained:**
Maya looked at the empty chair where her best friend used to sit. She felt sad because her friend had moved away and she missed her. The sadness made her not want to talk to anyone.

✅ **Appropriately Subtle:**
Maya's eyes kept drifting to the empty chair beside her. She opened her mouth to share the joke she'd just thought of, then closed it again. Some habits were hard to break.

#### Example 2: Character Motivation
❌ **Over-Explained:**
Alex volunteered to go first because he wanted to prove he was brave. He was afraid, but he didn't want the others to know he was scared, so he acted confident even though he wasn't.

✅ **Appropriately Subtle:**
"I'll go first." Alex's voice came out steadier than he felt. He stepped forward before anyone could see his hands shaking.

#### Example 3: Foreshadowing
❌ **Over-Explained:**
The old woman's warning about not opening the box would turn out to be important later. This was a clue that something bad would happen if they opened it.

✅ **Appropriately Subtle:**
"Some things are better left closed." The old woman's eyes lingered on the box. "Remember that."

#### Example 4: Character Relationships
❌ **Over-Explained:**
Marcus and Jen were siblings, and even though they argued a lot, they really loved each other deep down. When it mattered, they would always help each other.

✅ **Appropriately Subtle:**
"You're an idiot," Jen said, but she was already moving to stand beside him. "Lucky for you, I'm an idiot too."

### What to Trust Readers to Understand

- [ ] Emotional cause and effect from context
- [ ] Character motivations from actions and dialogue
- [ ] Passage of time from scene changes
- [ ] Physical descriptions from a few key details
- [ ] Relationships from how characters interact
- [ ] Stakes from the situation itself
- [ ] Thematic elements woven through the story

## 8. Rhythm and Pacing Guidelines

**Vary paragraph length to control pacing and reader experience.**

### When to Use Different Paragraph Lengths

#### Long Paragraphs (5-8+ sentences)
- **Use for:** Descriptions, worldbuilding, calm moments, reflection
- **Effect:** Slows the pace, creates atmosphere, gives readers time to breathe
- **Example:**

The library stretched in every direction, so vast Maya couldn't see the walls. Shelves rose three stories high, connected by spiral staircases and narrow bridges. Books lined every surface: ancient tomes with cracked leather bindings, slim volumes with gold-edged pages, scrolls tied with faded ribbon. The air smelled like old paper and vanilla, with an underlying hint of something else, something magical. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light streaming through high windows. Somewhere in the distance, she heard pages turning, though she couldn't see anyone else. This was the kind of place you could get lost in, and not just physically.

#### Medium Paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- **Use for:** Normal action, dialogue exchanges, general narration
- **Effect:** Maintains steady pace, most common paragraph length
- **Example:**

Alex pushed open the door and froze. The room beyond wasn't the classroom he'd expected. Instead, bookshelves stretched in every direction, rising so high he couldn't see their tops.

#### Short Paragraphs (1 sentence)
- **Use for:** Emphasis, emotional beats, action sequences, transitions
- **Effect:** Speeds pace, creates impact, demands attention
- **Example:**

She reached for the book.

Her fingers passed right through it.

#### Single Word Paragraphs
- **Use for:** Maximum emphasis, turning points, shock
- **Effect:** Creates dramatic pause, huge impact
- **Use sparingly** (once or twice per chapter maximum)

**Example:**

Gone.

### Example Passage with Good Pacing

Maya ran.

Behind her, footsteps pounded against stone. Getting closer. She pushed herself faster, lungs burning, legs screaming for her to stop. The corridor seemed endless, stretching and stretching with no end in sight.

There. A door, barely visible in the shadows.

She slammed into it full force, scrabbling for the handle. Locked. No, not locked, just stuck. She threw her weight against it once, twice. The footsteps were right behind her now. She could hear breathing that wasn't her own.

The door flew open. She tumbled through, spun, and shoved it closed. Her hands found a bolt and she slid it home. Something crashed against the door from the other side, hard enough to rattle her teeth.

She backed away, still breathing hard. Safe. For now.

## 9. Image Description Requirements

**Every image description must be a concise, vivid prompt that advances story, character, or theme.**

### Hard Requirements

- [ ] **Length:** 2-4 sentences exactly
- [ ] **Word Count:** 40-60 words maximum
- [ ] **Purpose:** Must advance plot, character development, or theme
- [ ] **Sensory Details:** Include specific visual details (lighting, colors, mood)
- [ ] **Character Focus:** If characters appear, show emotion through body language
- [ ] **Avoid:** Generic descriptions, static poses, explaining the obvious

### Weak vs. Strong Examples

#### Example 1
❌ **Weak (Generic, no story):**
Maya stands in a library. There are lots of books. She looks at them. The library is big.

✅ **Strong (Advances plot + character):**
Maya stands dwarfed by impossible shelves that spiral into shadow, her hand outstretched toward a glowing book that hovers just beyond her reach. Her expression mixes wonder with uncertainty, bathed in the book's golden light while darkness presses close behind her.

#### Example 2
❌ **Weak (Static, no emotion):**
Two kids sit at a table. They are doing homework. One kid has a book.

✅ **Strong (Shows relationship + emotion):**
Alex hunches over a scroll covered in glowing symbols while Maya leans close, pointing urgently at something he missed. Their heads nearly touch, lit by the scroll's eerie blue light, their shadows looming large against the library wall.

#### Example 3
❌ **Weak (No atmosphere):**
A dark forest. Trees everywhere. A path going through it.

✅ **Strong (Creates mood + stakes):**
A narrow path winds between ancient trees whose branches interweave overhead, blocking out the sky. In the distance, something glimmers through the shadows: either an exit or a trap, impossible to tell which.

#### Example 4
❌ **Weak (Too vague):**
The magic room looks magical. There is magic everywhere. It's very magical.

✅ **Strong (Specific, sensory):**
Streams of colored light spiral from floor to ceiling, forming constantly shifting patterns. Maya stands at the center, hands raised, her hair floating weightlessly around her face as objects orbit her body like planets around a star.

### Image Description Formula

**[Character action/position] + [specific environment detail] + [lighting/atmosphere] + [emotional element]**

✅ **Example:** Lia crouches before an ornate door carved with strange symbols, her fingers tracing the grooves as golden light seeps from the cracks. Her face shows equal parts determination and fear, shoulders tense like she knows there's no going back.


---

## 10. Magic System Rules

**If your story includes magic, establish clear rules and limitations.**

### Core Principles

- [ ] **Consistent:** Magic follows established rules
- [ ] **Costly:** Magic requires something (energy, sacrifice, risk)
- [ ] **Limited:** Characters can't do everything with magic
- [ ] **Earned:** Magical ability/knowledge comes from effort or discovery
- [ ] **Sensory:** Magic has visible/tangible effects

### Example Magic System Framework

**Type:** Symbolic/Glyph-based magic
**Source:** Ancient written language that shapes reality
**Limitations:**
- Must draw/trace symbols precisely
- More complex effects require more complex symbols
- Drawing takes time and concentration
- Can't cast if hands are bound or injured
- Symbols glow/fade based on user's energy level

**Cost:**
- Physical exhaustion (proportional to effect)
- Risk of magical backlash if done incorrectly
- Needs light to see what you're drawing

**Learning Curve:**
- Start with simple, single-glyph spells
- Gradually combine symbols for complex effects
- Takes practice to draw quickly/accurately under pressure

### Showing Magic in Action

❌ **Vague:** Maya used magic to open the door.

✅ **Specific:** Maya traced the opening glyph in the air, her finger leaving glowing lines that hung like neon. The symbol pulsed once, twice, and the lock clicked. Her hand dropped to her side, trembling with the effort.

---

## 11. Emotional Beat Construction

**Build emotional moments using a three-step process: Physical → Action → Realization**

### The Three-Step Formula

1. **Physical Sensation:** What does the character feel in their body?
2. **Action/Reaction:** What do they do in response?
3. **Internal Realization:** What do they understand/realize? (Often implied, not stated)

### Examples

#### Example 1: Betrayal
**Step 1 (Physical):** The words hit Maya like cold water. Her stomach dropped, and for a second she couldn't breathe.

**Step 2 (Action):** She took a step back, then another. Her hand found the wall behind her.

**Step 3 (Realization):** "You knew." Her voice came out flat. "This whole time, you knew."

#### Example 2: Breakthrough
**Step 1 (Physical):** The pieces clicked together in Alex's mind like a lock opening. His skin tingled with sudden understanding.

**Step 2 (Action):** He grabbed Maya's arm. "Wait. Say that again. What you just said, say it again."

**Step 3 (Realization):** The pattern had been there all along. They'd just been looking at it wrong.

#### Example 3: Loss
**Step 1 (Physical):** Lia's throat closed up. Her eyes burned, but she wouldn't cry. Not here. Not now.

**Step 2 (Action):** She turned away, focusing on the horizon. Anything but the empty space beside her where someone should have been standing.

**Step 3 (Realization):** Some changes you couldn't undo. Some goodbyes were forever.

#### Example 4: Hope
**Step 1 (Physical):** Something warm bloomed in Maya's chest. Her shoulders, tight for days, finally relaxed.

**Step 2 (Action):** She met Alex's eyes and saw her own hope reflected back. Maybe. Just maybe.

**Step 3 (Realization):** They weren't done fighting yet.

### Why This Works

- **Grounds emotion** in physical reality (readers feel it)
- **Shows character response** through action (readers see it)
- **Trusts reader** to understand the emotion without naming it
- **Creates rhythm** that feels natural and earned

---

## 12. Metaphor and Simile Guidelines

**Use comparisons sparingly and make them fresh, age-appropriate, and sensory.**

### Good vs. Bad Examples

#### Similes (Using "like" or "as")

❌ **Bad (Cliché):**
- As brave as a lion
- Like a deer in headlights
- Screamed like a banshee
- As quiet as a mouse

✅ **Good (Fresh):**
- The silence pressed down like a weighted blanket
- Her thoughts scattered like marbles on a hardwood floor
- Time moved like honey dripping from a spoon
- The magic felt like carbonation under her skin

#### Metaphors (Direct comparison)

❌ **Bad (Too abstract or complicated):**
- Her heart was a tempest-tossed ship navigating the turbulent seas of emotion
- The library was a labyrinth of literary wonderment

✅ **Good (Concrete and clear):**
- Fear wrapped cold fingers around her heart
- The words were barbed wire, catching and tearing
- Exhaustion dragged at her limbs like invisible weights

### Guidelines for Strong Comparisons

- [ ] **Draw from kid's world:** School, sports, family, food, weather, animals, games
- [ ] **Keep it simple:** One clear comparison, not layered metaphors
- [ ] **Make it sensory:** Readers should feel/see/hear the comparison
- [ ] **Avoid clichés:** If you've heard it a hundred times, don't use it
- [ ] **Match tone:** Funny metaphors for light moments, serious ones for heavy scenes
- [ ] **Use sparingly:** 1-2 per chapter, maximum

### Age-Appropriate Comparisons

**Good sources for middle grade:**
- Video games (but avoid specific game references that will date)
- School experiences
- Weather and nature
- Food and eating
- Sports and movement
- Household items
- Pets and animals

**Example:**
The spell wobbled and died like a video game character that just lost its last life. One second it was there, the next it was gone, leaving only the ghost of its glow in Maya's vision.

## 14. Red Flags to Avoid

**Watch for these common weaknesses and eliminate them ruthlessly.**

### ❌ Red Flag Checklist

- [ ] **Repetitive sentence starts:** Three or more sentences in a row starting with the same word (She/He/The/It)
- [ ] **Was/Were constructions:** "She was running" instead of "she ran"; "he was scared" instead of showing fear
- [ ] **Filter words:** "She felt," "he saw," "she heard," "he noticed," "she realized" (just show it happening)
- [ ] **Stating emotions directly:** "sad," "happy," "angry," "scared" as labels
- [ ] **Over-explaining:** Telling readers what they can infer from context
- [ ] **Weak verbs:** Walked, went, got, said (in every instance), looked, saw
- [ ] **Adverb abuse:** "Quickly," "slowly," "angrily," "sadly" instead of showing through action
- [ ] **Cliché phrases:** "Heart skipped a beat," "butterflies in stomach," "blood ran cold"
- [ ] **Too many exclamation points:** More than 1-2 per chapter
- [ ] **Purple prose:** Overly flowery or complicated descriptions
- [ ] **Modern slang:** "OMG," "YOLO," specific brand names, memes
- [ ] **Info dumps:** Paragraphs of explanation or backstory that stop the action
- [ ] **Talking heads:** Long dialogue with no action beats or sensory details
- [ ] **Passive voice:** Unless specifically needed for effect

### Before/After: Fixing Multiple Red Flags

❌ **Before (Multiple red flags):**
Maya was feeling nervous as she slowly walked toward the door. She felt her heart beating fast. She saw the handle and noticed it was glowing slightly. She was scared but she reached for it anyway. "Here goes nothing!" she said loudly.

✅ **After (Red flags eliminated):**
Maya's stomach twisted into knots. Each step toward the door felt heavier than the last. The handle glowed faint blue in the darkness. Her hand trembled as she reached forward. "Here goes nothing." The words came out barely above a whisper.


---

## 16. Voice and Tone Examples

### Narrator Voice (Third Person Limited)

**Guidelines:**
- Stays close to protagonist's perspective
- Uses vocabulary the character would use
- Reflects protagonist's mood and understanding
- Can be slightly more articulate than dialogue, but not drastically
- No information the protagonist doesn't know

✅ **Good Narrator Example:**

The library shouldn't exist. Maya had walked past this wall a hundred times, maybe a thousand, and it had always been just a wall. Solid. Boring. Normal. But now a door stood where no door should be, and worse, it was open. She could see light spilling out, golden and warm and completely impossible.

Her brain offered several explanations, each more ridiculous than the last: hallucination, prank, alien abduction, too much time reading fantasy novels. None of them felt right. None of them explained the way her skin tingled just standing this close, or the way the air smelled different here. Like old paper and lightning and something else she didn't have a name for.

Magic. The word popped into her head unbidden.

No. Magic wasn't real. Everyone knew that.

Except.

### Protagonist Voice (First Person Alternative)

**If writing in first person, deepen the character's unique perspective:**

✅ **Good First Person Example:**

Look, I'm not saying I believe in magic. I'm just saying that doors don't usually appear out of nowhere in the middle of walls I've walked past my entire life. And they definitely don't glow. Or hum. Or make my fingers tingle when I get too close.

So either magic is real, or I've finally lost it. Both options are equally terrifying, if I'm being honest.

I should walk away. That's what a smart person would do. But I've never been good at doing the smart thing when the interesting thing is right there, practically begging me to be stupid.

I reach for the handle.

### Supporting Character Voice in Scene

**Show distinct personality even in description:**

✅ **Example (Alex's POV moment):**

"This is the best worst idea we've ever had." Alex bounced on his toes, grinning like someone who definitely hadn't thought through the consequences. Maya called it his "about to do something stupid" face. He called it optimism.

✅ **Example (Lia's POV moment):**

Lia surveyed the situation with all the enthusiasm of someone who'd been asked to eat broccoli for dessert. "Right. A magical library. Because that's a normal thing that happens. What's next, talking animals? A wardrobe that leads to winter wonderland?"

## 17. Punctuation Guidelines

### ❌ STRICTLY PROHIBITED: Em-Dashes

**Never use em-dashes (—) in any context.** They create visual clutter and lazy sentence construction.

### ✅ Alternatives to Em-Dashes

#### 1. **Periods (Create separate sentences)**

❌ Em-dash: The door opened—slowly, silently—and Maya held her breath.

✅ Period: The door opened. Slowly, silently. Maya held her breath.

#### 2. **Commas (For pauses and asides)**

❌ Em-dash: She reached for the book—the one with golden binding—and pulled.

✅ Comma: She reached for the book, the one with golden binding, and pulled.

#### 3. **Restructure (Make it cleaner)**

❌ Em-dash: Maya wanted to go home—wanted it more than anything—but the door had vanished.

✅ Restructured: Maya wanted to go home more than anything, but the door had vanished.

❌ Em-dash: The library was endless—or seemed endless—or maybe it was changing.

✅ Restructured: The library was endless. Or seemed endless. Or maybe it was changing.

#### 4. **Fragments (For emphasis and punch)**

❌ Em-dash: She had one chance—just one—and she couldn't mess it up.

✅ Fragment: She had one chance. Just one. She couldn't mess it up.

#### 5. **Parentheses (For genuine asides, use sparingly)**

❌ Em-dash: The spell—if you could even call it that—barely worked.

✅ Parentheses: The spell (if you could even call it that) barely worked.

**Note:** Use parentheses rarely. Often better to restructure entirely.

### Other Punctuation Guidelines

#### Ellipses (...)
- **Use for:** Trailing off, hesitation, unfinished thoughts
- **Limit:** 1-2 per chapter maximum
- **Example:** "I think maybe we should... no, never mind."

#### Semicolons (;)
- **Use for:** Connecting closely related independent clauses
- **Limit:** Rare in middle grade; prefer periods or commas
- **Example:** The door was locked; they'd have to find another way.

#### Colons (:)
- **Use for:** Lists, explanations, dramatic reveals
- **Example:** She had three options: run, hide, or fight.

#### Question Marks (?)
- **Use freely:** Natural for middle grade voice
- **Example:** "What just happened?"

#### Exclamation Points (!)
- **Use sparingly:** 1-2 per chapter maximum in narration
- **Dialogue:** More freely, but avoid overuse
- **Never double:** Never use multiple (!!) or mixed (?!)

#### Commas (,)
- **Use generously:** For natural pauses and clarity
- **Oxford comma:** Always use it (red, white, and blue)
- **Avoid comma splices:** Two independent clauses need a period or semicolon

### Punctuation for Dialogue

✅ **Correct Format:**
- "I found something," Maya said.
- "You did?" Alex leaned closer.
- "Don't touch it!" She grabbed his wrist.
- She whispered, "They'll hear us."

❌ **Common Mistakes:**
- "I found something." Maya said. [Wrong: should be comma]
- "You did"? Alex leaned closer. [Wrong: question mark should be inside quotes]
- "Don't touch it"! She grabbed his wrist. [Wrong: should be comma or period inside, no exclamation after]
