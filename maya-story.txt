## Story

### Spread 1: ma-01.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Ordinary world + desire hint

#### Description

Maya paints in her Madrid bedroom, creating bold colorful art, until a shimmer of light appears that doesn't match her paints.

#### Page 5 (Left) - Character in their ordinary world

**Visual:**
Maya sits cross-legged on her bedroom floor surrounded by paint supplies,
her pink-streaked sandy-blond hair catching afternoon light from the
window. Bold colorful paintings cover the walls. She's painting a dance
scene with energetic brushstrokes, tongue poking out in concentration.
Music plays softly in the background.

**Text:**
Maya's brush swept across the paper in bold strokes—bright pink, electric
blue, sunshine yellow. She was painting a dancer mid-leap, all energy
and motion. "That's not right," she muttered, adding more pink. Then
more blue. The painting got louder, bolder, more Maya. Her cousin Elise
would probably paint it gentle and perfect. But Maya liked it loud.

#### Page 6 (Right) - First hint of something different

**Visual:**
Maya freezes, paintbrush hovering, as the painted dancer on her paper
begins to glow with golden light that has nothing to do with her paints.
The glow pulses gently, inviting. Her eyes widen with delighted curiosity.
Pink paint drips forgotten from her brush. The light seems to dance in
rhythm with music only it can hear.

**Text:**
The dancer on her paper started to glow. Maya blinked, but the light
didn't fade. It pulsed softly, goldenly, moving like the figure wanted
to dance right off the page. Her paint couldn't do that. She leaned
closer, brush forgotten. The glow brightened as if responding to her
attention. "Whoa," Maya breathed. "Are you magic?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 2: ma-02.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Inciting incident

#### Description

Maya touches the glowing dancer and finds herself pulled into Kathaél, where performances and dances are frozen mid-movement.

#### Page 7 (Left) - Discovery of the problem

**Visual:**
Maya stands between worlds, her paint-stained fingers touching a shimmering
portal where her painting transformed into a doorway. Through it, she sees
a meadow with frozen dancers—shadow figures stuck mid-leap, mid-spin,
unable to complete their movements. Golden threads connect them but flicker
weakly. Her athletic build is poised on tiptoes, ready to leap through.

**Text:**
When Maya touched the glowing dancer, the painting opened like a door.
Through it she saw a meadow filled with frozen performances—dancers
stuck mid-leap, musicians silent with instruments raised, performers
captured in moments that should have flowed into the next. Golden threads
connected them all, flickering like candles about to die. Something was
very wrong.

#### Page 8 (Right) - Decision to act

**Visual:**
Maya steps fully into Kathaél, standing in the meadow of frozen performances.
Her Madrid bedroom fades to translucent behind her. She spins once,
testing the space, and frozen dancers seem to lean toward her motion.
Golden threads from the Heart Crystal drift closer. Her expression shows
bold determination mixed with excited curiosity.

**Text:**
Maya stepped through, and her bedroom dissolved like watercolor in rain.
The meadow surrounded her, silent where it should have been full of music
and movement. She spun experimentally, and the frozen dancers seemed to
sway toward her, yearning. "You need someone to help you finish," Maya
understood. She grinned, bold and ready. "Perfect. I love a challenge."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 3: el-ma-03.yaml (joint with EL)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)

#### Description

Maya and Elise discover each other in a fading meadow, both trying obvious solutions that don't work. The cousins recognize each other with joy and surprise.

#### Page 9 (Left) - Trying the obvious solution

**Visual:**
Maya leaps and spins in the center of a faded meadow, her movements bold
and energetic. She wears her signature pink-streaked hair flying as she
dances, trying to bring life back through movement. Grey flowers surround
her, unresponsive. In the distance, a figure with paint-stained hands
kneels among the flowers.

**Text:**
Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like
wind itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life. Her
feet pounded the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely
stirred. She landed hard, breathing fast, and spun again. Nothing. In
the distance, someone knelt among the grey blooms, moving carefully.

#### Page 10 (Right) - Realizing it doesn't work

**Visual:**
Elise sits back on her heels, paintbrush lowering, as Maya bounds over.
Both girls freeze mid-motion as recognition hits. Maya's expression shifts
from determined to shocked to delighted. Elise's eyes widen with surprise
and joy. Grey flowers surround them. Golden threads pulse overhead, connecting
their presence.

**Text:**
"Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop, dust flying. Her cousin looked up from
her painting, eyes going wide. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright
and startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said
at exactly the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if
recognizing their connection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 4: ma-04.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Attempt #2 (ask the expert)

#### Description

Maya searches for guidance on the proper technique to restore the frozen performances.

#### Page 11 (Left) - Seeking guidance

**Visual:**
Maya follows golden threads through the forest, dancing as she goes—
little leaps and spins. The threads lead her toward a performance
pavilion where multiple paths meet. She moves with natural athleticism,
her pink-streaked hair bouncing. Her expression shows confident
determination mixed with slight uncertainty about what comes next.

**Text:**
Maya danced along the thread-paths, hoping they'd lead to someone who
knew the secret. There must be a right way to perform, a proper technique
she was missing. The threads led her to a pavilion where performance
paths crossed. "Someone here has to know the correct steps," she said,
bouncing on her toes.

#### Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction with warning

**Visual:**
Maya stands at the pavilion where performance paths diverge. The threads
pulse and point toward strange territory ahead—stages that shift shape,
audiences made of shadow, performances that follow no rules she recognizes.
A fox watches from nearby, its expression cautionary. Maya swallows but
sets her chin determinedly.

**Text:**
The threads pulsed and pointed ahead, toward performance spaces that
made no sense. Stages that changed shape. Dances with no choreography.
Songs with no melody. A fox met her eyes, and Maya felt the warning:
this would be harder than performing for her teachers or friends. "Okay,"
Maya said, rolling her shoulders. "I can be brave."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 5: ma-05.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)

#### Description

Maya enters a vast performance space where hundreds of shows are frozen, and meets a performer who insists on rigid perfection.

#### Page 13 (Left) - Entering unfamiliar territory

**Visual:**
Maya stands at the edge of an enormous amphitheater where hundreds of
frozen performances fill the space—dancers mid-leap, singers with mouths
open, artists with brushes raised. All stuck. All silent. The Heart
Crystal pulses dimly in the distance. A nearby dancer crumbles to dust.
Maya's eyes widen with alarm at the scale.

**Text:**
The amphitheater stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen performances
filled every stage, every platform, every corner. Dancers stuck mid-leap.
Singers frozen on their notes. Artists captured mid-brushstroke. The
Crystal pulsed dimmer in the distance. A nearby dancer crumbled to dust,
her performance lost forever. "Oh no," Maya whispered. "This is really,
really bad."

#### Page 14 (Right) - Encountering misleading help

**Visual:**
A dramatic performer in elaborate costume gestures sharply, demonstrating
perfect rigid technique. Behind them, frozen dancers strain against
invisible rules. The performer snaps at Maya to stand straighter, point
her toes more, stop moving so wildly. Maya's natural flowing style
clashes with the rigid demands. Her expression shows doubt and discomfort.

**Text:**
"Posture!" A performer in elaborate costume snapped fingers at Maya.
"Technique! Form! You must perform CORRECTLY!" They demonstrated perfect
rigid movements, each gesture sharp and controlled. Maya tried to copy,
but her body wanted to flow and bounce and add her own flair. The frozen
dancers around them seemed to strain harder, as if the rules were choking
them. "This feels wrong," Maya said quietly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 6: ma-06.yaml
**Node Type:** Mirrored Node | **Beat:** Midpoint: new insight / pattern

#### Description

Maya exhausts herself trying to perform what shadow-audiences want, then discovers that being authentically herself is her true power.

#### Page 15 (Left) - Recognizing what doesn't work

**Visual:**
Maya sits cross-legged at the edge of an empty amphitheater stage,
breathing hard. Shadow-audiences fill the seats, each row demanding
something different. Her pink-streaked hair is disheveled. A compass
rests beside her, its needle spinning wildly. She looks exhausted and
small.

**Text:**
Maya sat down hard, too tired to keep dancing. One shadow-audience wanted
big leaps, another wanted gentle twirls, another wanted perfect technique.
She'd tried to give them all what they asked for, and none of it felt
right. The compass beside her spun in confused circles. She hugged her
knees. "I don't even know what I want anymore."

#### Page 16 (Right) - Discovering a new pattern

**Visual:**
Maya stands center stage and dances her own way—bold, playful, mixing
styles without caring about perfect form. The shadow-audiences fade
away. The compass's needle points straight at her heart, glowing. Real
flowers bloom at her feet with each authentic movement, their colors
bright and true.

**Text:**
Maya stood. She started dancing again, but this time for herself. Bold
leaps mixed with silly spins. Her pink-streaked hair flying. Not perfect,
not proper, just...Maya. The shadow-audiences dissolved like smoke. The
compass needle swung toward her and held steady, pointing at her heart.
Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage, bright and real and
exactly right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 7: ma-07.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Rising stakes: almost works

#### Description

Maya dances authentically and restores several performances, but shadow-audiences make her question if being herself is enough.

#### Page 17 (Left) - Making progress toward goal

**Visual:**
Maya dances freely in a small performance space, her movements bold and
uniquely hers—mixing styles, adding playful spins, letting her pink-streaked
hair fly. Around her, frozen performers begin moving again, finding their
own authentic styles. A lantern burns steady on a post. Her expression
shows joyful focus. This is working.

**Text:**
Maya danced like herself—bold leaps mixed with silly twirls, ballet mixed
with hip-hop, nothing perfect but everything real. Around her, frozen
performers began moving again, each finding their own authentic style.
A ballerina added a hop. A singer tried a new note. The lantern beside
her burned steady. "Yes!" Maya spun, delighted. "Just be yourself!"

#### Page 18 (Right) - Realizing something is missing

**Visual:**
Shadow-audiences appear in the seats, murmuring criticism. "Too wild."
"Not proper." "Where's the technique?" Maya's dancing falters. The
lantern flame wavers. Behind her, the performers she restored begin
freezing again, their authenticity dimming under the pressure of
judgment. Her confident expression cracks to uncertainty.

**Text:**
Then shadow-audiences appeared in the seats, whispering. "Too wild."
"Not proper technique." "She's showing off." Maya's movements faltered.
Was being herself really enough? Maybe she should dance more... correctly?
The lantern flickered. Behind her, the freed performers began freezing
again, their authentic styles dimming. "Wait, no," Maya said, but her
voice sounded small. "I thought..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 8: ma-08.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** All-is-lost / emotional low

#### Description

Maya stands before shadow-audiences that judge every move, believing her authentic self isn't enough to help.

#### Page 19 (Left) - External obstacles intensify

**Visual:**
Maya stands frozen center stage in a vast amphitheater packed with
shadow-audiences, each row demanding something different from her.
"Be proper!" "Stop showing off!" "Where's your training?" Dark clouds
gather overhead. The Heart Crystal cracks audibly. A nearby performance
dissolves into grey smoke. Her athletic frame looks small and vulnerable.

**Text:**
The amphitheater filled with shadow-audiences, all judging. One section
wanted perfect ballet. Another wanted serious art. Another wanted her
to stop being so loud, so bold, so much. Dark clouds gathered. The
Crystal cracked louder. A performance beside her dissolved into smoke.
"I'm just me," Maya whispered. "Is that really not enough?"

#### Page 20 (Right) - Inner doubt and discouragement

**Visual:**
Maya sits cross-legged on the empty stage, arms wrapped around herself,
her pink-streaked hair hanging forward to hide her face. The shadow-audiences
loom in the darkness. Her paint-stained hands rest empty in her lap. A
small butterfly lands nearby, its wings dull grey. One weak thread glows
faintly.

**Text:**
Maya sank down onto the stage, trying to make herself smaller. Maybe
everyone was right. Maybe her wild dancing and mixed styles and loud
colors were just showing off. Maybe she should be more like... she didn't
even know who. The butterfly landed nearby, its wings grey. But Maya
noticed it hadn't flown away. And one thread still glowed, faint but real.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 9: ma-09.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Deepening choice / inner shift

#### Description

Maya remembers why she started dancing—for herself—and chooses to perform authentically regardless of judgment.

#### Page 21 (Left) - Making the choice to continue

**Visual:**
Maya stands, pushing her pink-streaked hair back determinedly. The
shadow-audiences still loom, but she's not looking at them anymore.
She's looking at the grey butterfly, at the weak thread, at the empty
stage that's waiting. Her posture shifts to bold and ready. Paint-stained
hands open at her sides.

**Text:**
Maya stood. The shadow-audiences were still there, still judging. But
she remembered her bedroom, painting dancers because she loved how they
moved. Not for teachers. Not for perfect technique. For the joy of it.
"I didn't come here to perform for you," Maya said to the shadows. Her
voice grew stronger. "I came here to be myself."

#### Page 22 (Right) - Discovering the missed clue

**Visual:**
Maya dances boldly, authentically, mixing every style she loves. The
shadow-audiences dissolve like smoke. Golden threads shimmer into
visibility, connecting her to warmth beyond the stage—someone else
choosing courage at the same moment. The butterfly's wings bloom with
color. Flowers grow where she dances. The stage transforms.

**Text:**
Maya danced—big bold leaps, silly spins, mixing ballet with hip-hop
with moves she just invented. The shadow-audiences dissolved. Golden
light rippled through the air, warm as a hug from someone far away being
brave at exactly the same moment. The butterfly's wings burst into color.
Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage. "Being myself," Maya
laughed, "is exactly enough."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 10: ma-10.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Climax: big action

#### Description

Maya brings her authentic wild beautiful self to the Heart Crystal, choosing to offer her true performance despite uncertainty.

#### Page 23 (Left) - Facing the final challenge

**Visual:**
Maya stands at the Heart Crystal's base, hands pressed against the
performance-facet. Through the clear surface, she sees other facets—
one glowing with stories, one bright with restored challenges. Her
authentic messy beautiful performance waits to be offered. Cracks
spread across the crystal. Her hands tremble slightly.

**Text:**
Maya stood at the Crystal's base, her wild authentic performance ready
to offer. It wasn't proper. It wasn't what teachers would call correct.
Through the crystal, she saw other facets glowing with their own truths.
Her performance felt too loud, too much, too Maya. "What if it's not
good enough?" she thought. But it was honest. It was hers.

#### Page 24 (Right) - Taking decisive action

**Visual:**
Maya dances her authentic performance into the Crystal facet—all her
bold energy, mixed styles, playful spirit flowing as golden light.
Where they connect, an explosion of color blazes out. Cracks seal
with sounds like laughter. Golden threads pour from the facet, carrying
her truth: being authentically yourself gives others permission to do
the same.

**Text:**
"It's not proper," Maya said out loud. "But it's true." She danced—
every wild beautiful authentic part of herself flowing toward the facet.
For one breathless moment, nothing happened. Then—color exploded where
she touched crystal. Not just one color but every color she'd ever loved,
blazing like fireworks. Cracks sealed themselves with sounds like laughter
and music. Golden threads poured out, carrying the message: be yourself.

### Spread 11: ma-11.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Resolution (external)

#### Description

The performance facet blazes with authentic expression, and Maya receives paint that glows with courage.

#### Page 25 (Left) - Goal achieved, external reward

**Visual:**
The Heart Crystal blazes with every color imaginable, the performance
facet spinning and dancing with light. Maya's authentic performance
weaves into the structure, its wild energy making the whole crystal
more vibrant. Between her hands appears a small paint pot filled with
colors that shift and glow. The butterfly from before circles, wings
brilliant.

**Text:**
The Crystal blazed with every color Maya had ever loved and some she'd
never imagined. Her wild authentic performance wove itself into the
pattern, and somehow its boldness made everything more beautiful. Light
gathered in her palms until a paint pot appeared—small, perfect, filled
with colors that glowed and shifted. The butterfly landed on her shoulder,
wings brilliant. "I was always enough," Maya breathed.

#### Page 26 (Right) - Beginning the return

**Visual:**
Maya walks home along a path lined with performing flowers and dancing
trees, the paint pot secure in her hands. Around her, frozen performances
complete themselves—each one unique, authentic, true. A fox dances past.
Her Madrid bedroom window glows warmly in the distance, her bold paintings
visible through the glass.

**Text:**
Maya walked home, the paint pot warm in her hands. All around, frozen
performances finished themselves—each dancer finding their own style,
each artist creating their own truth. A fox danced past and Maya laughed,
spinning with it. "Thank you," she called to Kathaél. The window to her
bedroom gleamed ahead, her bold colorful paintings waiting.

Maya returns to her Madrid bedroom and her painting, but now she creates with full confidence in her authentic style.

#### Page 27 (Left) - Returning to ordinary world

**Visual:**
Maya sits cross-legged on her bedroom floor in the same position as
the opening, surrounded by paint supplies. But now the magical paint
pot from Kathaél sits among her ordinary paints, glowing softly. Her
pink-streaked hair catches light the same way, but her posture radiates
confidence. The music plays. She's painting with bold joyful energy.

**Text:**
Maya's bedroom looked the same: afternoon light, paint everywhere, music
playing softly. But she didn't feel the same. She picked up her brush
and opened the magical paint pot. The colors inside shifted and glowed,
responding to her boldness. "Okay," she said to her blank paper. "Let's
make something wild and true."

#### Page 28 (Right) - Transformed by the journey

**Visual:**
Maya paints with fierce joy—bold strokes, mixed colors, energy flying
off the page. The painting shows dancers in her own style: wild, authentic,
uniquely Maya. Parts of it glow with golden light. Her other paintings
on the walls seem brighter. Through the window, a golden thread shimmers.
The colorful butterfly from Kathaél rests on the windowsill, watching.

**Text:**
Maya painted like herself—big bold strokes, colors that clashed and sang,
energy that couldn't be contained. Not perfect. Not proper. Just true.
Parts of her painting glowed with golden light, the same light she'd
brought to Kathaél. Outside her window, a golden thread danced in Madrid
sunlight. The butterfly from the meadow sat on her sill, wings brilliant.
Maya grinned. "Being yourself," she said, "is the best adventure."

### Meeting Node with Elise (EL)

#### Before (from Elise's story)

##### Spread 2: el-02.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Inciting incident

###### Description

Elise touches the glowing drawing and finds herself pulled into Kathaél, where colors are fading and need someone who truly sees.

###### Page 7 (Left) - Discovery of the problem

**Visual:**
Elise stands between worlds, her fingertips touching a shimmering portal where
her drawing transformed into a doorway of light. One foot lifts as she's gently
pulled forward. Through the portal, a meadow appears with faded colors, flowers
washed out like sun-bleached watercolors. A luminescent butterfly rests on her
shoulder.

**Text:**
When Elise touched the glowing flower, the paper opened like a door. Through
it she saw a meadow, but something was wrong. The colors looked tired, like
crayons left too long in the sun. Pink flowers that should have been bright
were barely more than grey. Behind her, her bedroom faded to a whisper.

###### Page 8 (Right) - Decision to act

**Visual:**
Elise steps fully into Kathaél, standing in the faded meadow. Her ordinary
bedroom has become translucent behind her. Golden threads from the Heart Crystal
reach toward her, thin and dim. Her watercolor set hangs from her wrist. Her
expression shows wonder and gentle concern as she surveys the colorless landscape.

**Text:**
Elise stepped through, and her room dissolved like morning mist. The meadow
stretched around her, beautiful in shape but heartbreaking in color. Golden
threads drifted overhead, faint as old cobwebs. She understood without being
told: this world was losing something precious, and it had called to her. Maybe
because she noticed things others missed.

#### Shared/Connected Page

##### Spread 3: el-ma-03.yaml (joint with EL)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)

###### Description

Maya and Elise discover each other in a fading meadow, both trying obvious solutions that don't work. The cousins recognize each other with joy and surprise.

###### Page 9 (Left) - Trying the obvious solution

**Visual:**
Maya leaps and spins in the center of a faded meadow, her movements bold
and energetic. She wears her signature pink-streaked hair flying as she
dances, trying to bring life back through movement. Grey flowers surround
her, unresponsive. In the distance, a figure with paint-stained hands
kneels among the flowers.

**Text:**
Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like
wind itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life. Her
feet pounded the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely
stirred. She landed hard, breathing fast, and spun again. Nothing. In
the distance, someone knelt among the grey blooms, moving carefully.

###### Page 10 (Right) - Realizing it doesn't work

**Visual:**
Elise sits back on her heels, paintbrush lowering, as Maya bounds over.
Both girls freeze mid-motion as recognition hits. Maya's expression shifts
from determined to shocked to delighted. Elise's eyes widen with surprise
and joy. Grey flowers surround them. Golden threads pulse overhead, connecting
their presence.

**Text:**
"Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop, dust flying. Her cousin looked up from
her painting, eyes going wide. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright
and startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said
at exactly the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if
recognizing their connection.

#### After (from Elise's story)

##### Spread 4: el-no-04.yaml (joint with NO)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #2 (ask the expert)

###### Description

Noah and Elise cross paths at a luminous crossroads where the Heart Crystal's threads converge, discovering they're both trying to help and neither has all the answers.

###### Page 11 (Left) - Seeking guidance

**Visual:**
A crossroads beneath an ancient willow where forest paths meet. Golden threads
flow through the branches, some frayed and flickering. Noah stands on the left
path, notebook tucked under his arm, reaching toward a thread. In the distance,
the Heart Crystal pulses weakly, more threads drifting loose.

**Text:**
"I've tried everything." Noah followed the threads to a crossroads beneath
an ancient willow, hoping someone here might know what he was missing. The
Crystal glowed through the trees, dimmer than before, more threads
unraveling. He reached toward one, and it hummed warmly. But the path it
suggested led deeper into unfamiliar territory.

###### Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction with warning

**Visual:**
Elise stands on the right path, watercolor set at her wrist, observing a
different thread. Between the children, threads flow and intersect, creating
a lattice of golden light. Both turn toward each other, curious. The willow's
branches glow brighter where their paths nearly touch.

**Text:**
Noah spotted her at the same moment she spotted him. A girl with paint-stained
fingers, reaching for the threads just like he was. "Are you trying to help
them too?" he called. She nodded. "They keep rejecting everything I try."
"Same." Something warm spread through his chest. He wasn't alone in this.
The threads between them pulsed brighter and felt warm, like sunshine on skin.
