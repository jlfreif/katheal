      The Weaver creates a shimmering map in the air made of light-threads, showing Elise where
      she must go: the Echo Hollow, where voices become visible and words have power. Elise studies
      the map carefully, committing every detail to memory the way she does with her drawings. The
      fading paperbird rests weakly in her hands. The Weaver's expression is both encouraging and
      concerned. "The hollow amplifies truth but also reveals silence. You must find your voice
      there, or both you and the paperbird will fade."

      The Weaver's warning scared Elise: "To save the paperbird, you must speak aloud what you see,
      what you feel, what you know. Silence may feel safe, but sometimes the bravest thing is to
      be heard."

      Elise leaves the grove, following the map's path. The woods grow darker and the path winds
      downward into a hollow filled with thick mist. The fading paperbird barely glows now, its
      colors almost gone. Other paperbirds escort her to the hollow's edge but can't follow—this
      is Elise's journey alone. She stands at the entrance to the misty hollow, clutching her
      sketchbook like a talisman, visibly anxious but determined. Her gentle courage shows in
      her steady, if trembling, first step forward.

      The Echo Hollow waited below—dark, misty, unknown. Elise's quiet voice had always felt like
      a weakness. Now it might be the only thing that could save her paperbird. She walked forward,
      scared but determined.
