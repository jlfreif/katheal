      Max's room transformed into an inventor's workshop. A desk covered with circuit boards,
      wires, batteries, and half-built gadgets. Max (12 years old, straight red hair parted down
      the middle, tall and slim, wearing black t-shirt and light blue basketball shorts) hunches
      over a small mechanical device, soldering iron in hand, tongue between teeth in concentration.
      His trombone case leans in the corner. Blueprints and calculations cover the walls. A
      basketball sits on his bed. His latest experiment—a device meant to sort things automatically—
      sits partially assembled. His expression shows intense focus mixed with analytical problem-
      solving. The room feels organized chaos, every tool precisely placed.

      Max adjusted the tiny gear one more time, checking his calculations. The automatic sorter
      should work—the math was perfect, the design logical. He flipped the switch. Gears whirred,
      then clunked to a stop. Failed again. He grabbed his notebook, scribbling notes about what
      went wrong. Every failure taught him something. He'd figure this out eventually. Science
      demanded patience.

      The failed invention suddenly sparks with golden light, gears spinning on their own, sorting
      not objects but beams of light into different colors. Max jerks back in his chair, eyes
      wide, watching as golden threads pour from the device and weave through his room like
      intelligent light. The threads sort themselves into patterns: questions here, answers there,
      possibilities floating between. One thread forms words in the air: "Some problems need
      exploration, not calculation." His blueprints flutter despite no wind. The basketball
      levitates slightly. His expression shifts from shock to fascinated curiosity. The atmosphere
      crackles with impossible possibility.

      The device blazed with golden light, working but not the way he'd designed. Threads poured
      out, sorting themselves into patterns his math hadn't predicted. Beautiful, impossible
      patterns. Words formed in the light: "Some problems need exploration, not calculation."
      Max's analytical brain wanted explanations, but the threads didn't wait for logic. One curled
      around his wrist, tugging playfully toward somewhere beyond equations and blueprints.
