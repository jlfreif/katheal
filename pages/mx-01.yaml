      Max stands in his driveway shooting basketball free throws, his red
      hair bright in afternoon sun. A basketball hoop hangs above the garage.
      Around him, chalk marks on the pavement show failed attempts and
      corrections. His trombone case leans against the garage door. His jaw
      is set with determination, but frustration shows in his tense shoulders.

      Clang. The ball bounced off the rim again. Max snatched it up and reset his position, checking his feet, his grip, his elbow angle. Everything should work. He'd analyzed every part. But shot after shot clanged wrong.

    visual: |
      Max freezes mid-shot as a golden thread floats through the air, weaving
      between the garage and the hoop. The thread pulses with urgent light,
      one end frayed and flickering. The basketball hovers forgotten in his
      hands as he stares. His expression shifts from frustration to curiosity.

      A shimmer caught his eye. Golden thread drifted through the air, bright and impossible. But something looked wrong with it. The end flickered weakly, unraveling like a rope coming apart. Max dropped the ball. It bounced away, forgotten. The thread pulsed brighter, pulling gently toward the trees behind his house.
