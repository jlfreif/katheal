      Max's driveway on a sunny afternoon. Max (12 years old, red hair parted down the middle,
      slim and athletic, wearing black t-shirt, light blue basketball shorts, blue basketball
      shoes) shoots baskets with confidence. The ball swishes through the net. Chalk marks on
      the pavement show various shooting positions he's been practicing. His trombone case leans
      against the garage door. He's mid-mime routine, pretending to sign autographs, grinning.

      Max bounced the basketball, grinning. Swish. He caught it, spun, shot from the free throw line. Swish again. "And the crowd goes wild!" He did a quick mime routine, pretending to sign autographs. The afternoon sun felt good. Everything felt good.

      The same driveway, but now a golden thread drifts through the air past the basketball hoop.
      Max stands holding the basketball, frozen mid-dribble, staring at the thread. The thread
      pulses with bright golden light but its edges flicker and fray. It tugs gently toward the
      woods behind his house. Max's expression shows curiosity and interest, not fear. The
      basketball is forgotten in his hands. The atmosphere shifts from playful to intrigued. Text

      A golden thread drifted past the hoop. Max caught it mid-dribble, ball forgotten. The thread pulsed bright, but its edges flickered and frayed. It tugged toward the woods, urgent and alive. Max tilted his head. "Okay, that's new." He pocketed the ball and followed, jogging easily.
