    visual: |
      Maya sits cross-legged at the edge of an empty amphitheater stage,
      breathing hard. Shadow-audiences fill the seats, each row demanding
      something different. Her pink-streaked hair is disheveled. A compass
      rests beside her, its needle spinning wildly. She looks exhausted and
      small.

      Maya sat down hard, too tired to keep dancing. One shadow-audience wanted
      big leaps, another wanted gentle twirls, another wanted perfect technique.
      She'd tried to give them all what they asked for, and none of it felt
      right. The compass beside her spun in confused circles. She hugged her
      knees. "I don't even know what I want anymore."

    focus: Discovering a new pattern

    visual: |
      Maya stands center stage and dances her own way—bold, playful, mixing
      styles without caring about perfect form. The shadow-audiences fade
      away. The compass's needle points straight at her heart, glowing. Real
      flowers bloom at her feet with each authentic movement, their colors
      bright and true.

      Maya stood. She started dancing again, but this time for herself. Bold
      leaps mixed with silly spins. Her pink-streaked hair flying. Not perfect,
      not proper, just...Maya. The shadow-audiences dissolved like smoke. The
      compass needle swung toward her and held steady, pointing at her heart.
      Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage, bright and real and
      exactly right.
