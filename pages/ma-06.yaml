      An art gallery carved into a hillside, walls lined with faded paintings that have lost
      their color and life. Maya stands before an easel holding a half-finished painting, her
      brush poised carefully, trying to paint "correctly" with proper technique. The painting
      is technically accurate but lifeless, colors muted and dull. Around her, other canvases
      show her previous attempts—all careful, all faded. A lantern hangs on the wall, its flame
      barely visible, casting almost no light on her work. Her expression shows concentration
      mixed with growing doubt. The gallery feels like a museum of dead things rather than a
      space of creation.

      Maya painted carefully. Perfect brushstrokes. Balanced composition. The painting stayed lifeless. Around her, canvas after canvas of careful, correct, faded work. The lantern dimmed.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Maya abandons her careful technique and paints with wild, joyful strokes, her whole
      body moving with the art. Bright pink, electric blue, vibrant orange splash across the
      canvas in bold, confident swirls. The pink streak in her hair seems to glow as she works.
      The lantern on the wall blazes brilliantly now, illuminating the entire gallery. Around
      her, the faded paintings burst back into color, responding to her authentic boldness.
      Colors drip and splash, alive and moving. Her expression is pure joy and freedom. The
      gallery transforms into a celebration of vibrant life.

      Maya threw the rules away. Wild pink, shocking blue, sunset orange. She painted like she danced. Bold and free and completely herself. The lantern blazed. Her canvas exploded with life. Around her, every faded painting burst back into color.
