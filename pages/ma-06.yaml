      Maya stands in a Library alcove where riddles are carved into ancient wood. She starts to read
      them quickly, making snap judgments. "This one means courage. That one means fear." But the
      carvings don't glow. They don't respond. A quiet voice stops her—maybe from the Library itself,
      or from deeper wisdom. She pauses, frustrated. Looking quickly hasn't worked. Trusting surfaces
      hasn't worked. Her expression shows reluctant willingness to try something different. The grey
      carvings wait patiently. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Maya rushed through carved riddles. This means courage. That means fear. Done! But the carvings didn't glow. Didn't respond. Quick glances hadn't helped. Surface meanings hadn't helped. Maybe she needed to actually pause. Actually read. Really see.

      Maya kneels before one riddle, truly reading it for the first time without rushing to judgment.
      The words are "I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch will soon turn red."
      She doesn't jump to an answer. She reads it again. Again. Thinks about the layers. Surface:
      fire (turns things red). Deeper: time (always hungry for moments, finger on a clock). As she
      sees both meanings, the carving blooms with golden light! Golden threads weave through the air,
      connecting surface to depth. Her expression shows wonder and revelation. When you truly read
      with patience, riddles show their full truth. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at
      bottom.

      Maya knelt before one riddle. She didn't rush. She didn't judge. She just read. Really read. "I am always hungry, I must always be fed." She thought. Fire? Yes, surface meaning. But deeper? Time. Always hungry. Consuming moments. Both answers true! The carving blazed gold. When you truly read things, they showed you their full truth.
