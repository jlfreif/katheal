      Maya stands in a garden where everything looks dull and grey at first glance. She starts
      to walk past quickly, making snap judgments. "Boring. Plain. Nothing special." But a quiet
      voice stops her—maybe from the garden itself, or from deeper wisdom. She pauses, frustrated.
      Looking quickly hasn't worked. Trusting reflections hasn't worked. Her expression shows
      reluctant willingness to try something different. The grey garden waits patiently.

      Maya rushed through a grey garden. Boring. Plain. Nothing— But something made her stop. Quick glances hadn't helped. Mirrors hadn't helped. Maybe she needed to actually pause. Actually look. Really see.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Maya kneels down, truly observing one grey flower for the first time without rushing to
      judgment. As she watches patiently, she sees tiny movements—the flower breathing, roots
      pulsing with life beneath the soil, intricate patterns in the petals that weren't visible
      at first glance. The flower begins to glow with hidden inner light, revealing it was never
      grey at all—it was waiting for someone to truly see it. As she looks deeper at the garden,
      color blooms everywhere. Golden threads weave through the air. Her expression shows wonder
      and revelation.

      Maya knelt before one grey flower. She didn't judge. She didn't rush. She just watched. Really watched. The flower breathed. Roots pulsed underneath. Tiny patterns swirled in the petals. And then—it glowed. The grey was just the surface. Underneath lived so much color. When you truly saw things, they showed you their truth.
