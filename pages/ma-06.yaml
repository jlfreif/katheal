      Maya stands in a Library alcove filled with blank canvases. She paints quickly—a flower, a
      tree, a bird. Quick strokes, confident lines. But each painting flickers and fades. They don't
      hold. They don't live. A quiet voice stops her—maybe from the Library itself, or from deeper
      wisdom. She pauses, frustrated. Painting quickly hasn't worked. Speed hasn't worked. Her
      expression shows reluctant willingness to try something different. The blank canvases wait
      patiently. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Maya painted fast. Flower. Tree. Bird. Done, done, done! But each one flickered and faded. They didn't hold. Didn't live. Quick paintings hadn't helped. Speed hadn't helped. Maybe she needed to actually slow down. Actually be present. Really care.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Maya kneels before one blank canvas. She paints slowly this time—a single flower. She takes
      time with each petal, each curve of the stem, the texture of the leaves. She's present with
      the painting, giving it attention and care. As she works patiently, something magical happens—
      the flower begins to MOVE. It sways gently as if in a breeze. The petals breathe. It's ALIVE.
      Truly alive. And it STAYS—doesn't flicker, doesn't fade. The canvas blooms with golden light!
      Golden threads weave through the air. Her expression shows wonder and revelation. When you give
      art time and presence, it truly lives. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Maya knelt before one canvas. She didn't rush. She didn't judge. She just painted. Really painted. One flower. Slowly. Each petal given care. Each leaf given attention. And then—it MOVED. Swayed like a breeze touched it. The flower was ALIVE. And it STAYED. The canvas blazed gold. When you gave art time and presence, it truly lived.
