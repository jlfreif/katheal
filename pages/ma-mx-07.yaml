    visual: |
      A clearing in the Kathaél forest. A creature made of golden vines and light blocks the
      path - beautiful but intimidating. The creature moves fast, whip-quick tendrils snapping
      toward both Max and Maya. Max is on one side - dodging left, ducking under a vine, his basketball
      defensive stance clear with knees bent, hands up, ready to move. Maya is on the opposite side -
      using artistic, flowing movements to dodge the creature's attacks, paint-splattered messenger bag
      swinging. Both show excitement and focus on their faces. They're working in sync without planning
      it - two cousins finding their rhythm together. The creature isn't evil, just testing them. The
      forest glows around them. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      A creature made of vines and golden light blocked the path. It moved fast, whip-quick tendrils snapping toward Max and Maya. "Okay, so we're doing this?" Max dropped into a defensive stance. On the other side of the clearing, a girl with sandy-blond hair moved in sync - dodging, ducking, rolling. Max didn't know who she was, but they fought like a team. His basketball instincts, her artistic flow. Together, they matched the creature's rhythm.

    visual: |
      The creature is dissolving into peaceful golden light. Max and Maya both have their hands
      extended toward where the creature's crystal center was - they reached it at the same moment.
      Both are clearly tired - breathing hard, wiping sweat. Max stands on one side, Maya on the other,
      the dissolving creature between them. Maya is a girl with shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with
      a pink streak, wearing artist-style clothes with a paint-splattered messenger bag. They're both
      grinning at each other - surprised, impressed, exhausted. The cleared path stretches beyond them.
      The atmosphere is shared victory mixed with exhaustion. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white

      Max and the girl spotted the pattern together—the creature telegraphed its moves. Without speaking, they coordinated. He faked left, she went right, and they both touched the crystal at the creature's center at the same moment. It dissolved into light, peaceful. "Nice moves!" the girl said, grinning. "I'm Maya. Also trying to save this place." Max caught his breath. "Max. And that was exhausting." But they'd done it—together.
