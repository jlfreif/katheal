      A magnificent rainbow bridge arcs across a misty chasm, but parts of it are faded and grey.
      Maya stands on the bridge, hands glowing with vibrant pink and blue energy, touching the
      faded sections and watching them burst back into color. Max kneels nearby, pressing his
      palms against another grey section, his face scrunched in concentration as red and orange
      bloom under his touch. The restored sections glow brilliantly—red, orange, yellow, green,
      blue—creating a pathway of light across the void. Mist swirls below them. The partially
      restored bridge is breathtaking, pulsing with life where they've touched it. Hope radiates
      from both children's faces.

      Maya found Max at a rainbow bridge across a misty chasm. She pressed her hands down and pink bloomed under her fingers. Max grinned, making orange and red explode. Together they worked down the bridge, restoring color after color. "We're so close!" he called.

    focus: Realizing something is missing
    visual: |
      Maya and Max stand together before a dark gap in the bridge—a section where violet should
      be but remains stubbornly grey and lifeless. Both children have their hands pressed against
      it, faces showing concentration and growing concern. The rest of the bridge glows beautifully
      around them, making the missing piece even more obvious. Golden threads hover nearby but
      won't connect to the gap. Beyond the bridge, barely visible through the mist, something
      purple glimmers in the far distance, deep in the unknown forest. Both children follow the
      direction with their eyes, realizing where they'll need to go. The gap in the rainbow casts
      a shadow across their faces.

      Then they hit the gap. Where violet should be stayed dark and cold. Maya tried everything. Pink mixed with blue, every shade she knew. Nothing worked. "But where do we find it?" Maya asked, voice small. Through the mist, something purple glimmered far away.
