    focus: Fun action scene with creature
    visual: |
      A clearing in the Kathaél forest. A creature made of golden vines and light blocks the
      path - beautiful but intimidating. The creature moves fast, whip-quick tendrils snapping
      toward Max. Max is mid-action - dodging left, ducking under a vine, rolling. His basketball
      defensive stance is clear - knees bent, hands up, ready to move. His face shows excitement
      and focus. This is challenging but fun. The creature isn't evil, just testing him. The
      forest glows around them. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      A creature made of vines and golden light blocked the path to the next course. It moved fast, whip-quick tendrils snapping toward Max. "Okay, so we're doing this?" Max dropped into a defensive stance, basketball instincts kicking in. He dodged left, ducked right, rolled under a sweeping vine. His heart pounded. This was the most fun he'd had all day.

    focus: Victory but tired, meeting Maya
    visual: |
      The creature is dissolving into peaceful golden light. Max stands catching his breath, hand
      still extended toward where the creature's crystal center was. He's clearly tired - breathing
      hard, wiping sweat. Behind where the creature stood, Maya appears - a girl with shoulder-
      length sandy-blond hair with a pink streak, wearing artist-style clothes. She's grinning,
      impressed. Max looks surprised to see her but manages a tired smile. The cleared path
      stretches beyond them. The atmosphere is victory mixed with exhaustion. Text in Times New

      Max spotted the pattern—the creature telegraphed its moves, like a defensive player. He faked left, went right, and touched the crystal at the creature's center. It dissolved into light, peaceful. A girl with wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with a pink streak stood behind where the creature had been. "Nice moves!" Maya said, grinning. "I'm Maya. Also trying to save this place." Max caught his breath. "Max. And that was exhausting." But he'd done it.
