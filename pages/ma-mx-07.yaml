    visual: |
      An ancient bridge spanning a deep ravine, constructed entirely of crystallized
      starlight that shimmers and shifts like liquid light made solid. Maya (9 years
      old, sandy-blond hair with pink streak, bold and athletic) stands at one end,
      one foot testing the bridge's surface which ripples under her weight. Max (12
      years old, straight red hair, tall and slim) stands at the opposite end, also
      testing the bridge. The structure flickers between solid and translucent. Mist
      swirls in the ravine far below. Golden threads weave through the starlight,
      pulsing gently.

      The bridge stretched between them, made of starlight that wouldn't quite hold still.
      Maya tested it with one foot. It rippled like water. "Guess I'm trying this," she
      called across to the red-haired boy on the other side. "Me too," Max shouted back.
      They stepped on at the same moment. The bridge shuddered, then hummed.

    focus: Realizing something is still missing

    visual: |
      Maya and Max walk toward the center of the bridge from opposite ends, their
      combined weight and courage causing the starlight to crystallize and solidify
      beneath their feet. Where they meet in the middle, the bridge glows brightest and
      most stable. Both children grin at each other with recognition and relief. Golden
      threads spiral up from the bridge, forming a path forward. Behind them, the bridge
      remains semi-transparent, but ahead where they must go together, it becomes clearer
      and more solid. The ravine below still yawns dark and deep.

      With each step they took, the bridge grew more solid. Where they met in the middle,
      it blazed steady and strong. "It's working," Maya laughed. "Together," Max agreed,
      high-fiving her. But ahead, the path disappeared into mist. The bridge showed them
      something else was needed. Something distant. They'd have to find the others.
