      Following the symbols on the stones, Elise enters a grove where threads of light hang
      between trees like an enormous web—but beautiful, not scary. In the center sits the Weaver
      of Words: an ancient creature that looks part spider, part origami, part stardust. It weaves
      stories into visible threads. Elise approaches shyly, holding the fading paperbird gently
      in her cupped hands. The Weaver's many eyes turn toward her with kindness. Other paperbirds
      perch on the light-threads, watching.

      The Weaver of Words spoke in a voice like pages turning: "Ah, a paperbird who's forgetting
      its story." Elise held the trembling creature carefully. "How do I help it remember?"

      The Weaver gestures with delicate legs, showing Elise how paperbirds are made: from stories
      told with true voice, from words spoken with heart, from songs sung with courage. The
      light-threads glow as the Weaver explains, forming images of paperbirds being born from
      spoken words. Elise listens intently, her observant eyes catching every detail. The Weaver
      looks at her specifically: "This one needs someone to speak its truth, to give voice to what
      it carries. But finding voice is not easy for one who lives quietly."

      "Paperbirds are born from true voice," the Weaver explained. "This one fades because its
      story has been forgotten, unspoken. Only someone who truly sees can find the words it needs
      to hear." Elise's heart sank. She wasn't good at speaking up.
