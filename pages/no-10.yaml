  Noah stands at the very center of the Heart-Loom's nexus—a space where hundreds
  of golden threads converge from all directions, creating a dome of light around
  him. He's standing with his arms partially extended, palms forward, fingers spread.
  His whole body is tense with the weight of this moment, leaning slightly forward
  as if about to step into something he can't take back. In his right hand, barely
  held, is a new thread that has emerged from his own heart—visible as a golden
  strand that connects from his chest outward. This thread is unique: it pulses with
  his own truth, containing all his frustration, creativity, longing, and the honest
  acknowledgment that he doesn't have all the answers. His expression shows fear and
  courage mixed together: eyes wide open, jaw set with determination, but a slight
  tremble visible. Around him, the existing threads of the Heart-Loom wait, neither
  demanding nor rejecting—simply ready to receive what he offers. The light is
  brilliant but not harsh, golden and warm. The air seems to hold its breath. Below
  him, the ground is barely visible, as if he's standing on the threads themselves,
  suspended in this moment of truth. His notebook lies open at his feet, its pages
  blank and ready, representing possibility.

  Noah held his thread—woven from every mistake, every doubt, every moment he'd felt small. The Heart-Loom waited for him to choose: hide, or be honest.
