      Noah stands at the Heart-Loom's center, surrounded by converging threads of
      light. In his hands, he holds his own story-thread, but it trails off into
      nothing—unfinished, ending mid-sentence. His body is tense with the urge to
      complete it, to control it. The threads around him wait.

      The Heart-Loom's center glowed around him, threads converging from everywhere.
      Noah held his own thread, the story of this journey, and it ended mid-sentence:
      "He learned that—" His hands itched to finish it, to write the perfect ending.
      But that was the old way. The way that broke things.

    visual: |
      Noah releases his unfinished thread into the tapestry, arms open, palms empty.
      His expression shows fear and trust mingled together. The thread floats toward
      the pattern, still incomplete. Around him, golden light intensifies as the
      tapestry reaches toward his offering.

    text: |
      Noah opened his hands and let the unfinished thread go. No ending. No control.
      Just trust that the story knew what it wanted to become. The thread floated
      into the tapestry, and for one terrible moment, nothing happened. Then it
      began to write itself, words blooming in golden light.
