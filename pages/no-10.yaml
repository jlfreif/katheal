      Noah stands at the Heart-Loom's center, hundreds of golden threads converging
      from all directions, creating a dome of light around him. His arms extend
      partially, palms forward. From his chest, a new thread emerges, glowing with
      his own truth. His body is tense, leaning forward as if about to step into
      something irreversible.

      The Heart-Loom's center was a cathedral of light. Hundreds of threads
      converged around Noah, waiting. From somewhere inside his chest, a new
      thread emerged, thin and golden. His own thread. It contained every
      frustration, every doubt, every moment he'd felt like a failure. His
      hands trembled as he held it.

    focus: Taking decisive action

    visual: |
      Noah steps forward, both hands extended, the thread from his heart reaching
      toward the tapestry. His expression shows fear and courage mixed together,
      eyes wide open, jaw set with determination. The existing threads lean toward
      him, ready to receive what he offers. Golden light intensifies around his
      outstretched hands.

      He could hide his thread, keep his truth safe and small. Or he could offer
      it honestly, knowing the tapestry might reject it. Noah thought of everyone
      who felt like their words didn't matter. He stepped forward and let his
      thread go. It touched the tapestry, and the whole pattern blazed bright.
