      Noah stands at the Crystal's base, pressing his hand against the story-facet.
      It is cold and rough with cracks. Through the clear surface, he can see other
      facets—one shimmering with fading colors, another silent where music should be.
      In his other hand, his own story-thread glows, incomplete. His hand trembles.

      In his other hand, his own story-thread glowed, incomplete. His hand trembled.
      Every instinct screamed to write an ending right now, to make it perfect, to fix it.
      "But that's not courage," he whispered. "Courage is acting even when I don't understand."

    visual: |
      Noah releases his unfinished thread toward the Crystal facet, arms open, palms
      empty. His face shows fear and trust mingled together. The thread floats up
      toward the damaged facet. Light blazes from where the thread touches crystal.
      Cracks seal themselves with musical chimes. Golden threads pour from the facet.

      "I don't know how this ends," Noah said out loud. His voice shook. He opened his
      hand and let go. The thread floated up, up toward the damaged facet. For one terrible
      moment, nothing happened. Noah held his breath. Then—light blazed from where the
      thread touched crystal. Words wrote themselves in golden fire: "...that stories become
      real when someone is brave enough to let them." The Crystal blazed. Light shot through
      every facet. Cracks sealed themselves with musical chimes. Golden threads poured from
      the story-facet like a fountain, strong and bright and complete.
