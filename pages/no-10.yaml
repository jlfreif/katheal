  Noah places both the Cartographer's Compass and the feather charm on the pillar of light.
  The pillar accepts them, and brilliant golden light explodes outward—not destructive but
  illuminating. The light flows through Noah, warm and transforming. He sees every path he
  walked superimposed—the cave, the stones, the cliff, the pool—each one a necessary step.
  He sees Ellie at the fork, Bramblebeard's warning, the Fox's riddles. Everything connects.
  His eyes are closed but he's never seen more clearly.

  The path descended into the Heart of the Whispering Woods—a place few found because it
  could only be reached by trusting your own direction. Noah walked steadily, ready. The
  pillar of truth stood before him, humming with ancient power. "Show me," Noah said, "what
  I was always meant to find." Light poured through Noah—every choice, every doubt, every
  brave step forming a map inside his heart. The compass wasn't an object. It was a gift of
  knowing: trust yourself. Noah stood in the fading light, forever changed. The compass lived
  inside him now—not as certainty, but as courage to choose anyway.
