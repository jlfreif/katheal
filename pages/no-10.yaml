    visual: |
      Noah stands at the Heart-Loom's center, a vast tapestry of golden threads
      surrounding him. In his hands, he holds his own story-thread, frayed and
      unfinished. The tapestry pulses weakly, still unraveling. His body is tense,
      hands trembling with the urge to write an ending.

      The Heart-Loom surrounded him, vast and wounded, threads still unraveling.
      Noah held his own story-thread, the one that had led him here. It ended
      mid-sentence: "He learned that..." His hands trembled. Every part of him
      wanted to finish it, to write the perfect ending. "But that's not courage,"
      he whispered. "Courage is trusting something I can't control."

    visual: |
      Noah releases his unfinished thread into the tapestry, arms open, palms
      empty. His face shows fear and trust mingled together. The thread floats
      toward the pattern, still incomplete. Golden light intensifies as the
      tapestry reaches toward his offering, beginning to mend.

      "I don't know how this ends." Noah opened his hands and let go. The
      unfinished thread floated into the tapestry. For one terrible heartbeat,
      nothing happened. Then words began writing themselves, an ending he never
      would have imagined: "...that stories become real when someone is brave
      enough to let them." The Heart-Loom blazed with light, threads weaving
      together.
