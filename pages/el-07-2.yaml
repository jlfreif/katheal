      Elise attempts to speak her observations aloud, but the words come out as barely a whisper:
      "I see... the paperbird is... it's beautiful... it's..." The garden flowers lean toward her,
      trying to hear, but the words are too soft, too hesitant. The paperbird brightens slightly—
      it's working!—but not enough. Elise tries again: "The paperbird carries stories of..." But
      doubt creeps in. What if she's wrong? What if her quiet observations don't matter? The flowers
      begin to dim.

      Elise whispered her observations, but they came out too quiet, too uncertain. The paperbird
      flickered brighter for just a moment—but then faded again. Almost. She was almost there. But
      not quite.

      Exhausted and discouraged, Elise sinks to the ground beside the pool. The paperbird can barely
      glow now—nearly transparent. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the garden. In
      the distance beyond the garden, she can see sky-moths rising toward a cliff edge where the
      land drops away to open sky. The paperbird weakly tries to fly that direction. Elise feels
      defeated—she tried to find her voice but it wasn't strong enough. Something is still missing.
      She needs... what? Courage? Confidence? Truth?

      Elise slumped in defeat. She'd tried to speak, but her voice was still too small, too scared.
      The paperbird pointed toward a distant cliff where sky-moths danced. One more journey. But Elise
      felt so tired. Could she really do this?
