    focus: Making the choice to continue

    visual: |
      A circular clearing where dozens of golden threads spiral upward from the ground
      like a gentle tornado of light. Noah stands on the left side, his right foot
      lifted mid-step toward the threads, arms slightly extended forward. His face
      shows determination and wonder, eyes wide, catching the golden glow. Forest
      creatures have gathered to watch.

      The clearing pulled at something deep inside Noah. Golden threads spiraled
      upward, waiting for him to step closer, to offer something true. His feet
      felt heavy. His doubts whispered that he wasn't enough. But across the
      clearing, he saw the girl from before, stepping forward too.

    focus: Discovering the missed clue

    visual: |
      Elise mirrors Noah on the right side, also stepping forward, hands reaching
      out palms-up as if to receive something precious. Her expression is soft but
      resolute. The golden threads respond to their movement, brightening and swirling
      more vibrantly. The lighting is warm and hopeful, like dawn breaking.

      Elise saw the boy take his step, and something in her chest unclenched. She
      wasn't the only one afraid. She wasn't the only one choosing anyway. Her
      foot lifted. The threads swirled brighter. Two hearts, two different paths,
      one moment of shared courage. That was the missing piece all along.
