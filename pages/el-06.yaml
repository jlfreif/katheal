      Elise sits cross-legged on soft moss in a small clearing, having left behind
      the artist-spirit. Her watercolor set rests open but unused beside her. Both
      hands rest gently in her lap, palms up. The garish painted trees are visible
      in the distance behind her, a reminder of what doesn't work. Soft dawn light
      filters through the trees.

      Elise found a quiet clearing and sat down, her racing heart finally slowing.
      The spirit's loud colors hadn't helped. Her own painting hadn't helped. She
      was tired of trying so hard. Maybe the answer wasn't doing more. Maybe it
      was something else entirely.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern

    visual: |
      Elise's hands cup gently around a single faded flower, not painting it but
      holding space around it with tender attention. The flower slowly regains color,
      grey fading to pale lavender to soft purple. Golden threads drift closer,
      glowing brighter. A rabbit watches with approval. Luminescent pollen drifts
      through the air.

      Without thinking, Elise cupped her hands around a tiny grey flower, the way
      she might hold something fragile and precious. She didn't paint. She just
      noticed. Slowly, impossibly, color bloomed from the flower's center. Grey to
      lavender to purple, spreading petal by petal. Her breath caught. The flower
      didn't need fixing. It needed someone to truly see it.
