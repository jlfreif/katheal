      Back cover design with soft watercolor background in vibrant blues, warm creams,
      and mist blues. Golden threads create an energetic border around the edges, weaving
      into patterns, question marks, and musical notes. A small facet of the Heart Crystal
      glows softly in the upper corner, casting prismatic light. The golden threads form
      decorative frames for the text areas. At the bottom, tiny silhouettes of six children
      (representing all the characters) stand together, connected by shimmering golden threads.
      The overall atmosphere is bright, witty, and inviting, with delicate ink linework adding
      detail to the magical elements. Space in the center is left clear for text placement.
