  Back cover design with soft watercolor background in dynamic grays, warm creams,
  and vibrant blues. Golden threads create an energetic border around the edges,
  flowing like wind currents with musical notes and adventure symbols woven in.
  A small facet of the Heart Crystal glows softly in the upper corner, casting
  prismatic light. The golden threads form decorative frames for the text areas,
  with some threads appearing to pause in moments of stillness. At the bottom,
  tiny silhouettes of six children (representing all the characters) stand together,
  connected by shimmering golden threads. The overall atmosphere is dynamic yet
  thoughtful, inviting both motion and calm. Delicate ink linework adds detail to
  the flowing elements. Space in the center is left clear for text placement.

synopsis: |
  Micah is always in motion—running, climbing, exploring—so when golden threads
  invite him to the Library of Kathaél, he rushes in ready for adventure. But the
  Heart Crystal is cracking, and stories can't be saved by speed alone. To help,
  Micah must discover that sometimes the bravest thing you can do is pause and breathe.
