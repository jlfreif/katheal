    visual: |
      A wide meadow filled with wildflowers that appear to be losing their vibrant colors,
      like watercolors fading in real time. Micah (9 years old, half-Japanese with black
      hair and black eyes, athletic build) stands in the center, one hand extended toward
      a flower that shifts from brilliant purple to pale gray. Little Mona (2 years old,
      dark curly hair, curious bright eyes) toddles nearby, her head tilted as she watches
      the same phenomenon with wonder. Golden threads drift overhead but their glow
      flickers weakly. The forest behind them still glimmers with some magic.

      Micah watched the purple flower drain to gray right before his eyes. One second
      it blazed violet, the next it faded like old paint. "That's not supposed to
      happen," he muttered. A sound made him turn. A tiny girl, maybe two years old,
      stood three steps away, pointing at the same flower. Her eyes were huge and bright.

    focus: Decision to act together

    visual: |
      Micah crouches down to Mona's height, both children now at eye level as they
      examine a fading flower together. Their hands nearly touch as they reach toward
      it. Mona's expression shows determination despite her young age. Micah grins,
      recognizing a fellow adventurer. More flowers around them continue fading, creating
      a sense of urgency. Golden threads in the sky point toward the luminous forest,
      suggesting a direction to explore.

      "Colors go?" Mona said, her voice small but certain. Micah grinned. She got it,
      even at her age. "Yeah, they're disappearing. Want to figure out why?" She nodded
      so hard her curls bounced. "Together!" she declared. Micah stood, and Mona grabbed
      his hand. The threads overhead pulsed once, as if approving their partnership.
