      Elise descends into the Echo Hollow, where mist swirls thick and every sound echoes multiple
      times. The fading paperbird can barely fly now—it rests in her hands, colors flickering like
      a dying ember. From the mist emerges the Shadow Mimic: a creature made of smoke and whispers
      that takes the shape of whatever you most want to see. To Elise, it appears as a friendly
      version of herself—confident, loud, easy. The Mimic smiles in a way that seems too perfect.

      "You don't need to speak," the Shadow Mimic whispered in Elise's own voice. "I can speak
      for you. I can say everything you're too scared to say. No one will even notice it isn't you."

      The Shadow Mimic circles Elise, its smoky form shifting and promising easy answers. It offers
      to "speak" to the paperbird, to fix everything without Elise having to find her own voice.
      Elise looks tempted—it would be so much easier. The paperbird, though fading, trembles in
      warning. Around them, the hollow echoes with false promises bouncing off invisible walls.
      Elise's expression shows conflict: the easy way versus the true way. Her hands tighten
      protectively around the paperbird.

      Part of Elise wanted to say yes—let someone else speak, stay safe in silence. But the paperbird
      trembled. Somehow she knew: borrowed voice wouldn't save it. Only her own true words could.
