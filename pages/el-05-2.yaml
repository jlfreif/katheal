      Elise shakes her head slowly but firmly at the Shadow Mimic. "No," she says quietly—barely
      a whisper, but it's her own voice. The word echoes in the hollow, growing louder with each
      repetition until "NO" fills the space powerfully. The Shadow Mimic recoils, its false-Elise
      form dissolving back into smoke and shadows. The paperbird in Elise's hands glows slightly
      brighter—just a flicker, but it's the first time it's grown stronger instead of weaker. Elise
      realizes: her true voice, even when quiet, has power.

      "No," Elise whispered, and the word echoed until it became thunder. The Shadow Mimic vanished,
      and for the first time, her paperbird glowed a little brighter. Maybe her voice mattered more
      than she knew.

      The mist in the Echo Hollow begins to clear, revealing a path forward lit by faint starlight.
      In the distance, Elise can see tall standing stones that hum with music—the Singing Stones
      the Weaver mentioned. The paperbird, though still fading, manages to flutter weakly toward
      them. Elise follows, her gentle courage growing. Behind her, the Shadow Mimic's whispers fade
      into nothing. She's found the strength to reject false shortcuts and trust her own path, even
      when it's harder.

      The path cleared ahead, leading toward stones that sang in the distance. The paperbird pulled
      toward them weakly. Elise followed, feeling different—a little braver, a little more sure that
      her quiet voice mattered.
