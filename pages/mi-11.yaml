      The still garden transformed—now perfectly balanced between motion and pause, activity and
      rest. Wind chimes ring with purposeful rhythm. Creatures move with centered grace. Micah
      stands with the golden speed creature perched on his shoulder, both finally at peace. The
      crane appears, offering a gift: a small wind chime that rings only when someone takes a
      centering breath, a reminder to pause. Micah receives it with gratitude. His expression
      shows peaceful accomplishment. A path home shimmers, leading back. The atmosphere celebrates
      balance found.

      The garden glowed with perfect balance—motion and stillness, breath and movement, energy
      and rest. The crane gave Micah a tiny wind chime that would ring whenever he needed to
      remember to breathe. He understood. This was Kathaél's gift: the courage to pause when
      overwhelmed, to breathe before acting, to find center in chaos. The speed creature nuzzled
      his cheek, no longer an enemy but a friend. The path home opened. Time to go.

    visual: |
      Micah moves along the path home with new grace—running and leaping yes, but punctuated
      with perfect pauses, each movement preceded by centered breath. The wind chime hangs from
      his belt, ringing softly with his breathing rhythm. Golden light trails his movements. He's
      still energetic and active, still himself, but transformed by the power of pause. His
      expression shows joyful energy channeled through intention. The atmosphere celebrates energy
      made powerful through centering.

      Micah ran home, but differently now. Breathe, then leap. Pause, then vault. Center, then
      climb. The wind chime rang with his rhythm, reminding him. His movements were stronger,
      faster, better because they came from stillness. He was still energetic, still active, still
      himself. But now he knew: the courage to pause made everything else possible. Motion without
      breath was chaos. Motion from breath was power.
