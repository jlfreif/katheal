      The Heart Crystal's golden threads flow outward in beautiful, rhythmic pulses like
      breathing—expanding and contracting in gentle waves across the forest. Micah stands
      with both hands extended, and hovering above his palms is a small compass made of
      golden light. The compass needle spins slowly, deliberately, and with each rotation
      it creates visible breath-mist in the air. His face shows amazement and joy.

      The threads breathed. That's what it looked like—Kathaél itself breathing, golden
      light pulsing outward in gentle, living rhythms. Micah watched his small pause become
      something vast and vital. Then warmth gathered in his hands, forming into a compass
      of golden light. But this compass didn't point north. Its needle spun slowly, reminding:
      pause, breathe, see clearly. A gift. Proof that stillness had power.

    focus: Beginning the return

    visual: |
      Micah moves along a forest path with easy, balanced movements—not rushing, not
      frozen, but flowing naturally. The golden compass hangs from a light-thread around
      his neck, glowing softly. Creatures of Kathaél move with him: the moth flies
      alongside, a fox trots beside him, birds circle overhead. In the distance, his
      backyard with the parkour obstacles glows warmly through the trees.

      Micah tucked the compass around his neck, where it pulsed with gentle warmth against
      his chest. The path home stretched before him, and he moved along it with easy rhythm—
      not rushing, not forcing, just breathing and moving as one. The moth flew beside him
      like an old friend. A fox trotted at his heels. Even leaving, he carried Kathaél's
      rhythm with him: the courage to pause, to breathe, to see clearly in the chaos.
