      Micah sits in lotus position before the Heart Crystal, which now blazes with perfect
      light. The massive tangles have completely unwound, threads flowing freely in all
      directions like rivers of gold. His eyes are open now, face showing quiet pride and
      amazement. The wise tortoise approaches slowly and places a single glowing thread
      across Micah's palm. The thread pulses gently in rhythm with Micah's calm breathing.
      Forest creatures gather in celebration: the owl, the rabbit, even the hummingbird
      hovers nearby, finally still. Peace radiates through the clearing.

      The last tangle unwound. The Heart Crystal sang with light, every thread free and
      flowing. Micah opened his eyes slowly, almost afraid to move and break the spell.
      He'd done it. Not by being fast or strong, but by being still. The tortoise smiled.
      "You learned what few ever do," it said, offering a glowing thread. "That sometimes
      the bravest thing is simply to breathe."

    visual: |
      Micah walks calmly toward the shimmering portal home, no longer running or bouncing.
      His pace is measured and peaceful. The golden thread wraps around his wrist like a
      bracelet, pulsing softly with each breath he takes. He looks back at the glowing
      forest and the Crystal one last time, one hand raised in a wave. The creatures wave
      back. His expression shows he's changed: still energetic, but now carrying stillness
      inside him too. The portal glows gently, ready to take him home. Sunset colors fill the sky.

      Micah walked toward the portal. Walked, not ran. The golden thread on his wrist pulsed
      with his breath, a constant reminder. The forest around him glowed with the light of
      untangled threads. Part of him wanted to stay and explore, to run and climb and play.
      But home called. And now he carried something new inside: the knowledge that he could
      be still when he needed to. That pausing was its own kind of strength.
