  The siblings sit together in the meadow grass, Noah showing Elise his acorn, Elise showing
  Noah her starlight journal. The paperbird perches on Elise's shoulder, preening its vibrant
  wings contentedly. "Want to plant the acorn together?" Noah asks. Elise nods, pulling out
  her sketchbook. "And I'll draw everything," she says—speaking up easily now, knowing her
  observations matter. Behind them, the Whispering Woods rustle with approval. New adventures
  await, but for now, they're home.

  Elise walked home through the woods that had seemed so scary before. But now they felt like
  friends, celebrating her journey. Her paperbird sang beside her—fully alive, fully vibrant,
  fully seen. The Weaver gave Elise a gift: a journal made of starlight. "Write your observations,
  speak your truths," it said gently. "The world needs voices like yours—gentle but brave, quiet
  but clear." Elise nodded, understanding finally: her voice mattered. Elise stepped into the
  golden meadow where Noah waited. "You saved it!" Noah called, amazed. Elise smiled—shy but
  proud. "I found my voice," she said simply. Noah squeezed her hand. "It was always there. I'm
  glad you can hear it now too." They sat together sharing their treasures—acorn and paperbird,
  compass-wisdom and voice-courage. "Together," they both said. The woods whispered yes.
