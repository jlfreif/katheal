      The fully restored Heart Crystal glows brilliantly in the background, all six facets
      blazing with color and life. Elise stands in the clearing, hands cupped together, receiving
      a gift from the crystal—a small, glowing blue crystal pendant that pulses with light in
      rhythm with her heartbeat. Her expression shows joy and wonder. Around her, the forest
      is vibrant and alive, flowers blooming, golden threads flowing freely through the air,
      performers dancing in the distance. A golden pathway opens before her, leading back toward
      home. Her posture is graceful and centered, confident in a new way.

      The Heart Crystal pulsed one more time, sending a warm beam of light into Elise's hands.
      When the light faded, a small blue pendant rested in her palms, glowing in rhythm with her
      heartbeat. She understood. This was Kathaél's gift—a reminder that her authentic expression
      mattered, that being herself was enough. The crystal had been healed, and so had she. A
      golden path opened before her, leading home.

    focus: Beginning the return
    visual: |
      Elise walks along the golden pathway through the forest, the blue pendant now hanging
      around her neck, glowing softly. She moves with a dancer's grace but there's a new quality
      to it—less careful performance, more natural expression. She hums the same melody from the
      beginning, but now golden threads appear in the air around her, responding to her song.
      Small creatures peek from the undergrowth to watch her pass. Flowers bloom in her wake.
      Her face shows peaceful contentment mixed with quiet excitement about what comes next. The
      forest seems to celebrate her passage, every element alive and welcoming.

      Elise walked the path home, humming softly. Golden threads appeared with each note, dancing
      in the air around her like old friends. She wasn't the same girl who'd stepped through the
      mirror. She'd learned that authentic expression was magic, that being herself—silly, serious,
      graceful, messy—mattered more than perfect performance. The pendant glowed warm against her
      chest, carrying Kathaél's light home with her.
