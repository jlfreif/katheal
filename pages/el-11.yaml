      The Heart-Loom's threads glow warmly, interwoven with soft watercolor washes
      of lavender, rose, sage, and amber. Elise stands with both hands raised to
      chest height, and resting across her palms is a small, perfect paintbrush
      made of light and golden thread. Her expression shows quiet wonder and shy
      joy. Flowers bloom in soft hues around her.

      Color spread through Kathaél like watercolor on wet paper, gentle and alive.
      The threads glowed with soft hues: lavender, rose, sage, sky blue. Elise
      watched her small light become something vast and beautiful. Then warmth
      gathered in her palms, forming into a paintbrush of starlight. A gift. Proof
      that noticing mattered.

    visual: |
      Elise walks along a path lined with flowers in full, gentle color. The
      starlight paintbrush is tucked carefully into her pocket. Creatures of
      Kathaél watch her go: a rabbit hopping in a small circle, birds singing
      softly, a deer bowing its head. In the distance, her ordinary world glows
      warmly between the trees.

      Elise tucked the paintbrush into her pocket, where it hummed with soft warmth.
      The path home was lined with flowers that hadn't been there before, blooming
      in colors she had helped remember. A rabbit hopped beside her for a few steps.
      A deer bowed its head as she passed. Even leaving, she felt like she belonged.
