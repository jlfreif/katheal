      The fully restored Heart Crystal glows brilliantly in the background, all six facets
      blazing with color and life. Elise stands in the clearing, hands cupped together, receiving
      a gift from the crystal—a small, glowing blue crystal pendant that pulses with light in
      rhythm with her heartbeat. Her expression shows joy and wonder. Around her, the forest
      is vibrant and alive, flowers blooming, golden threads flowing freely through the air,
      performers dancing in the distance. A golden pathway opens before her, leading back toward
      home. Her posture is graceful and centered, confident in a new way.

      The crystal pulsed once more with brilliant light. It dropped a blue pendant into Elise's hands, warm and alive. It glowed with her heartbeat, in rhythm with her breath. Being herself was enough. Had always been enough. "Thank you," she whispered to the forest. The path home opened before her, golden and welcoming.

    visual: |
      Elise walks along the golden pathway through the forest, the blue pendant now hanging
      around her neck, glowing softly. She moves with a dancer's grace but there's a new quality
      to it—less careful performance, more natural expression. She hums the same melody from the
      beginning, but now golden threads appear in the air around her, responding to her song.
      Small creatures peek from the undergrowth to watch her pass. Flowers bloom in her wake.
      Her face shows peaceful contentment mixed with quiet excitement about what comes next. The
      forest seems to celebrate her passage, every element alive and welcoming.

      Elise followed the golden path back through the forest. She walked home humming softly. Golden threads danced with each note she sang. She'd learned that authentic was magic. That being herself, silly, serious, graceful, messy, mattered most of all. The pendant glowed warm against her chest, carrying Kathaél's light with her.
