      Noah sits at the edge of the Cliff of Gentle Winds, legs dangling over empty air. Below,
      the Whispering Woods stretch endlessly. The view is breathtaking but Noah barely sees it—
      he's hunched over, head in hands, compass lying beside him, its glow dim. The sun sets
      behind him, casting long shadows. Gentle winds stir his sandy blond hair. His posture
      radiates defeat. Then, soft footsteps approach from behind.

      Noah didn't look up as footsteps approached. "I can't do it, Ellie," he said quietly.
      "The compass keeps pointing forward, but I don't know if I'm strong enough to keep following."

      Ellie plops down beside Noah at the cliff's edge, her arrival wordless and perfect. She's
      slightly out of breath, holding something in her hands—a small charm she's been making. They
      sit side by side, feet dangling, wind flowing around them. Ellie doesn't speak immediately;
      she just sits with him, her presence steady. The wind carries warmth between them. Her
      expression shows gentle understanding, no judgment, only love.

      Ellie sat beside him without a word, just being there. The wind was soft and warm—the kind
      that makes you feel less alone. After a moment, she held out her hand. "I made you something."
