    focus: Trying the obvious solution

      Mona runs from toy to toy touching everything quickly—swing, slide, seesaw, sandbox toys—
      trying to wake them all up at once. Her little legs move fast, her hands reaching and
      patting and grabbing. She's enthusiastic and confident, thinking if she just touches
      everything, it will all wake up. The toys flicker and sputter but don't fully activate,
      confused by the scattered attention. Other children watch hopefully. Mona's expression shows
      determined effort, working hard but not seeing results. The atmosphere is one of energetic
      but misguided effort.

      Mona ran everywhere touching everything fast-fast-fast. "Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!" The toys flickered and fizzled. Too many things at once.

    visual: |
      Mona sits on the ground, tired and puzzled, toys flickering weakly around her. A wise old
      turtle appears, moving slowly and deliberately, its shell decorated with patient spiral
      patterns. It settles near Mona, meeting her eyes with kind understanding. Mona tilts her
      head—her signature move when curious. The turtle's slow, deliberate presence contrasts with
      Mona's scattered rushing. The atmosphere shifts from frantic energy to thoughtful calm.

      A turtle appeared. "Too fast, little one. Try one thing. Let it wake up slow." Mona looked at all the toys. One at a time seemed so slow. But her fast way hadn't worked.
