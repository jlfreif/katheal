    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Mona sits cross-legged on the mossy ground, surrounded by golden threads. She pulls at
      a knotted cluster with both hands, tongue poking out in concentration like she does when
      playing with her toys. The threads shimmer and shift but don't untangle the way she
      expects. Some float away from her grasp like bubbles. Her expression shows puzzlement but
      no frustration. Luminous mushrooms glow softly around her. A small blue bird perches on a
      nearby branch, tilting its head to watch her work.

      Mona grabbed the tangled threads and pulled, just like when her necklaces got knotted.
      But these threads slipped through her fingers like water. She tried again, more gently.
      They floated away before she could catch them. "Silly threads," she said, not mad, just
      curious. They didn't work like toys at all.

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work but discovering something

    visual: |
      Mona stops pulling and simply sits still, one hand resting palm-up on her knee. A single
      golden thread hovers above her open palm, glowing brighter than before. Her face shows
      pure wonder and delight as the thread begins to slowly unwind itself, responding to her
      calm presence. More threads drift closer to her, drawn by her fearless, patient energy.
      The blue bird has flown down to sit near her foot. Sunlight filters through leaves above,
      creating dappled patterns on the moss.

      Mona stopped trying to fix them and just sat very still. A thread floated to her hand
      all by itself. It glowed brighter, warmer. She giggled softly, and the thread began to
      unknot on its own, like it wanted to be untangled. "Oh!" More threads drifted closer.
      Maybe they needed something different than pulling. Maybe they just needed a friend.
