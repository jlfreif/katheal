      Mona runs through the Library chambers touching constellation pieces without stopping to wonder.
      Don't ask why—just do! She grabs floating stars and presses them randomly. She connects lines
      without checking patterns. She's moving fast, acting on everything, no questions. Constellation
      pieces light up but in chaotic, disconnected ways. Other creatures watch nervously. Books flutter
      with concern. She runs toward a beautiful glowing archway without pausing, drawn to its light.
      Her little legs pump with determination. Her expression shows toddler confidence. The atmosphere
      is chaotic action without thought. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona ran fast! No more why! Just do! She grabbed stars. Put them everywhere! Didn't look. Just ran! She saw a door. Ran to it!

      The archway suddenly isn't safe—it was an illusion hiding a gap in the Library floor, and Mona
      nearly runs over the edge into darkness below. The rabbit lunges forward and grabs her overalls,
      yanking her back just in time. Mona sits hard on the ground, breathing fast, scared. A wise
      tortoise appears slowly from behind a stack of books. "Too many questions makes you stuck," it
      says gently. "But no questions makes you reckless." Mona's eyes are wide. She looks at the edge
      she almost ran over. Her expression shows shaken realization. The atmosphere is the moment of
      understanding both extremes are dangerous. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The door was not real! Mona almost fell! The rabbit grabbed her. Mona sat down. Uh-oh! A turtle came. "Too many whys makes you stuck. No whys makes you fall. You need both."
