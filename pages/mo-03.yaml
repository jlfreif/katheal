      Mona runs through the garden touching everything without stopping to wonder. Don't ask why—
      just do! She pokes the butterflies (they scatter), pushes the flowers (they droop), splashes
      the fountain (water sprays wildly). She's moving fast, acting on everything, no questions.
      Other creatures watch nervously. She runs toward a beautiful glowing bridge without pausing.
      Her little legs pump with determination. Her expression shows toddler confidence. The
      atmosphere is chaotic action without thought.

      Mona ran everywhere doing everything. No more questions! Just do! She poked butterflies, pushed flowers, splashed fountains. Things moved but messily. She saw a glowing bridge. Didn't stop to look. Just ran toward it—

      The bridge suddenly isn't there—it was an illusion, and Mona nearly runs off the edge into
      a deep ravine. The rabbit lunges forward and grabs her overalls, yanking her back just in
      time. Mona sits hard on the ground, breathing fast, scared. A wise tortoise appears slowly.
      "Too many questions makes you stuck," it says gently. "But no questions makes you reckless."
      Mona's eyes are wide. She looks at the edge she almost ran over. Her expression shows shaken
      realization. The atmosphere is the moment of understanding both extremes are dangerous.

      —The bridge vanished. Mona's foot hit air. The rabbit yanked her back. She sat hard, heart pounding. A tortoise appeared. "Too many questions makes you stuck. No questions makes you reckless. You need both. Question when it matters. Act when it's time."
