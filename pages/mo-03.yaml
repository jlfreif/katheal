      Mona runs around the Library grabbing blocks without stopping to wonder. Don't ask why—just
      stack! She grabs floating blocks and tosses them onto the pedestal fast. Big ones, small ones,
      round ones, square ones—no pattern, no looking! She's moving fast, stacking everything, no
      questions. The tower grows tall but wobbly. Blocks teeter at odd angles. Other creatures watch
      nervously. Books flutter with concern. The tower sways. Mona reaches for one more block, not
      looking up at the dangerous wobbling tower above her. Her expression shows toddler confidence.
      The atmosphere is chaotic action without thought. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space

      The tower wobbles wildly—CRASH! Blocks tumble down around Mona! The rabbit lunges forward and
      pushes her back just in time. Blocks scatter everywhere. Mona sits hard on the ground, breathing
      fast, surprised. A wise tortoise appears slowly from behind a stack of books. "Too many questions
      makes you stuck," it says gently. "But no questions makes things fall. You need both—ask why,
      then try." Mona's eyes are wide. She looks at the fallen blocks all around her. Her expression
      shows shaken realization. The atmosphere is the moment of understanding both extremes are
      dangerous. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      CRASH! Blocks fell down! The rabbit pushed Mona back! Blocks everywhere! Mona sat down. Uh-oh! A turtle came. "Too many whys makes you stuck. No whys makes you fall. You need both."
