    visual: |
      Mona stands in the faded meadow, balancing precariously on one foot with
      her arms out wide for balance. Her face shows fierce concentration mixed
      with delight. The glowing block sits at her feet, pulsing warmly. The
      butterfly watches from a nearby flower, wings still mostly gray. Mona
      wobbles but keeps trying, her curly hair bouncing with each adjustment.
      Other faded creatures gather to watch—a pale rabbit, a colorless bird.

      "I show you!" Mona lifted one foot off the ground. Wobble, wobble. She
      stuck her arms out, tongue between her teeth. This was new! She'd never
      balanced on one foot before. Scary! But also... fun? She teetered left,
      then right, then—she got it! For three whole heartbeats, she stood on
      one foot, grinning huge. The glowing block blazed brighter. "See? Just
      try!" The butterfly's wings shimmered, colors starting to seep back in
      like watercolor paint.

    focus: Complication revealed

      The butterfly soars overhead with wings now brilliant blue and shimmering,
      trailing sparkles of light. Mona claps her hands above her head, jumping
      with joy. But as she celebrates, she notices the meadow around them is
      still fading—flowers wilting further, more toys losing color. In the
      distance, other creatures watch hopefully. A bunny with fading spots. A
      ball rolling to a stop, its red stripes turning pink. The crystal structure
      in the far distance pulses weakly.

      The butterfly's wings burst into brilliant blue! It lifted off the flower,
      wings catching light like stained glass. "I'm flying! I tried and I'm
      flying!" Mona jumped up and down, clapping. "Yay!" But when she looked
      around, her smile faded a little. The flowers were still pale. More toys
      looked sad and gray. A bunny hopped over, its spots almost invisible.
      Mona's little eyebrows scrunched together. One butterfly wasn't enough.
      Lots of things needed help to try again.
