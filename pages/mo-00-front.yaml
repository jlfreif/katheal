      Front cover illustration. Mona (2 years old, wavy ringlet short dark brown hair with
      natural curls, dark brown eyes, medium height for her age, balanced build, light blue
      overalls, white sneakers, white shirt) sits on the ground reaching toward golden
      threads with wonder and delight. Her expression is bright-eyed and curious, head
      slightly tilted in her characteristic way, with a big smile. Golden threads float
      gently around her like playful ribbons, some forming simple shapes like stars, hearts,
      and circles. Magical building blocks made of light float nearby. Behind her, the
      Library of Kathaél appears warm and welcoming, with soft glowing lights like a gentle
      fairy tale. The Heart Crystal rises in the background, but rendered softly and warmly,
      its facets creating gentle rainbow glows. The atmosphere is gentle and enchanting, with
      watercolor washes of soft blues, warm creams, gentle pinks, and honey golds. Delicate
      ink linework adds just enough detail to keep it warm and inviting. The scene captures
      toddler wonder meeting gentle magic.

      At the top of the cover, in elegant script: "The Library of Kathaél"
      Below that, in bold lettering: "Mona's Journey"
      At the bottom: "Courage to Try Something New"
