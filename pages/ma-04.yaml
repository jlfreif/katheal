    visual: |
      Maya follows golden threads through the forest, dancing as she goes—
      little leaps and spins. The threads lead her toward a performance
      pavilion where multiple paths meet. She moves with natural athleticism,
      her pink-streaked hair bouncing. Her expression shows confident
      determination mixed with slight uncertainty about what comes next.

      Maya danced along the thread-paths, hoping they'd lead to someone who
      knew the secret. There must be a right way to perform, a proper technique
      she was missing. The threads led her to a pavilion where performance
      paths crossed. "Someone here has to know the correct steps," she said,
      bouncing on her toes.

    focus: Receiving direction with warning

    visual: |
      Maya stands at the pavilion where performance paths diverge. The threads
      pulse and point toward strange territory ahead—stages that shift shape,
      audiences made of shadow, performances that follow no rules she recognizes.
      A fox watches from nearby, its expression cautionary. Maya swallows but
      sets her chin determinedly.

    text: |
      The threads pulsed and pointed ahead, toward performance spaces that
      made no sense. Stages that changed shape. Dances with no choreography.
      Songs with no melody. A fox met her eyes, and Maya felt the warning:
      this would be harder than performing for her teachers or friends. "Okay,"
      Maya said, rolling her shoulders. "I can be brave."
