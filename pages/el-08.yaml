      Elise sits collapsed at the edge of the musical notes chamber. She's completely exhausted from
      the guardian battle—muscles trembling, sweat-soaked, breathing hard. Her white sneakers are
      scuffed and torn. Inside the chamber, the musical notes pedestal pulses frantically. Floating
      above it are the most difficult rhythm patterns yet—impossibly complex combinations of notes
      showing triple spins mid-leap, rapid-fire sequences, syncopated beats requiring perfect timing.
      Worse, the chamber itself is unstable. Sections of floor fall away into darkness. Through the
      Library windows, the Heart Crystal pulses frantically, its cracks spreading fast, light dimming.
      Thunder rumbles. The musical paths she lit earlier flicker and start to fade. Time is running
      out. Everything is failing. Elise's face shows exhaustion and overwhelm. The challenge ahead
      looks impossible.

      After defeating the guardian, Elise reached the musical notes chamber. Then stopped cold. The pedestal showed impossible rhythms—triple spins mid-leap, rapid sequences she'd never tried. Worse, the floor crumbled, sections falling into darkness. Her legs shook. Muscles burned. The Heart Crystal cracked louder. The paths she'd lit earlier flickered, fading. Everything was failing. "I can't," she whispered, slumping down. "It's too hard."

      Elise still sits exhausted, but notices something: behind her through the Library's archways,
      the rhythm-paths she already completed glow softly—still lit by her journey. Every pattern she
      danced, every challenge she overcame, every moment of joy and technique combined—all still
      shining through the trees. A small bird lands on a nearby book and hops in a simple, joyful
      rhythm. One musical note on the pedestal glows brighter in response. Elise watches this, her
      expression shifting from defeat to quiet determination. She wipes sweat from her face and
      slowly pushes herself up to her feet, legs shaking. She takes a breath. The impossible pattern
      bottom.

      Elise looked back. Behind her through the Library, the paths she'd already danced still glowed. Every step she'd taken. Every challenge overcome. Still shining. A small bird hopped nearby, dancing its own simple rhythm. One note on the pedestal glowed brighter. She'd come this far. She pushed up to her feet, legs shaking. The impossible pattern waited. "One more try," she whispered. She stepped forward.
