      A darkening grove where Elise sits slumped against a tree trunk, legs drawn up, arms wrapped
      around her knees. Her usually graceful posture is collapsed and heavy. Around her, the
      flowers she helped revive earlier are wilting again, their colors fading. Golden threads
      that once danced in the air now lie limp on the ground. Shadows creep closer from the
      forest edges. Her dance shoes are dusty and worn. Her face shows deep exhaustion, eyes
      half-closed, expression defeated. The grove that was once bright with her authentic expression
      now dims back toward grey. The atmosphere weighs heavy with failure and fading hope.

      Elise couldn't move anymore. Every dance she'd performed, every song she'd sung, every
      authentic expression—it was all fading back to grey. She'd tried so hard to be herself,
      to bring life through movement, but the effort had drained her empty. Around her, the
      grove dimmed. The flowers wilted. Even the golden threads gave up, lying still and lifeless
      on the forest floor.

    visual: |
      Elise still slumped against the tree, but her head is turned to watch a small bird on a
      nearby branch. The bird, no bigger than her thumb, sings a tiny melody and hops in a little
      dance, completely unselfconscious. Its movement is imperfect but joyful, pure and free.
      One wilted flower beneath the bird's branch perks up slightly, responding to the simple
      authentic expression. Elise's eyes focus on this, her expression shifting from defeat to
      quiet recognition. A single golden thread near the bird begins to glow faintly. The shadows
      pause their advance. The tiniest spark of hope flickers in Elise's eyes.

      A tiny bird landed nearby, barely bigger than her thumb. It hopped and chirped its own
      silly dance, completely unafraid of looking foolish, just being itself. One flower beneath
      it brightened, responding to that simple truth. Elise watched, throat tight. Even the
      smallest authentic expression mattered. Even when exhausted, even when failing, the choice
      to keep showing up counted for something. She wasn't ready to stop yet.
