      Elise sits collapsed at the edge of the final rhythm-path leading to the Heart Crystal. She's
      completely exhausted from the golem battle—muscles trembling, sweat-soaked, breathing hard.
      Her white sneakers are scuffed and torn. Ahead, the path is the most difficult yet: footprints
      showing impossible combinations—triple spins mid-leap, rapid-fire sequences, gaps that require
      perfect timing. Worse, the path itself is crumbling, sections falling away into darkness. In
      the distance, the Heart Crystal pulses frantically, its cracks spreading fast, light dimming.
      Thunder rumbles. The paths she lit earlier flicker and start to fade. Time is running out.
      Everything is failing. Elise's face shows exhaustion and overwhelm. The challenge ahead looks
      impossible.

      After defeating the golem, Elise reached the final path. Then stopped cold. The footprints showed impossible moves—triple spins mid-leap, rapid sequences she'd never tried. Worse, the path crumbled, sections falling into darkness. Her legs shook. Muscles burned. The Heart Crystal cracked louder. The paths she'd lit earlier flickered, fading. Everything was failing. "I can't," she whispered, slumping down. "It's too hard."

      Elise still sits exhausted, but notices something: behind her, the rhythm-paths she already
      completed glow softly—still lit by her journey. Every path she danced, every challenge she
      overcame, every moment of joy and technique combined—all still shining. A small bird lands
      on a nearby rock and hops in a simple, joyful rhythm. One small section of the crumbling
      path ahead glows brighter in response. Elise watches this, her expression shifting from
      defeat to quiet determination. She wipes sweat from her face and slowly pushes herself up
      to her feet, legs shaking. She takes a breath. The impossible path waits. But she's come
      this far. She can try.

      Elise looked back. Behind her, the paths she'd already danced still glowed. Every step she'd taken. Every challenge overcome. Still shining. A small bird hopped nearby, dancing its own simple rhythm. One section of the crumbling path ahead glowed brighter. She'd come this far. She pushed up to her feet, legs shaking. The impossible path waited. "One more try," she whispered. She stepped forward.
