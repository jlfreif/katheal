      A darkening grove where Elise sits slumped against a tree trunk, legs drawn up, arms wrapped
      around her knees. Her usually graceful posture is collapsed and heavy. Around her, the
      flowers she helped revive earlier are wilting again, their colors fading. Golden threads
      that once danced in the air now lie limp on the ground. Shadows creep closer from the
      forest edges. Her dance shoes are dusty and worn. Her face shows deep exhaustion, eyes
      half-closed, expression defeated. The grove that was once bright with her authentic expression
      now dims back toward grey. The atmosphere weighs heavy with failure and fading hope.

      Elise ran toward the Heart Crystal's grove. Needed to finish this. But exhaustion hit like a wave. She collapsed against a tree. The flowers she'd helped earlier wilted again. Golden threads lay limp on the forest floor. In the distance, the Crystal dimmed further, its cracks spreading. If she gave up now, everything—the dancers, the flowers, the authentic courage she'd found—would fade to nothing. "I tried so hard," she whispered. "But it's still not enough."

      Elise still slumped against the tree, but her head is turned to watch a small bird on a
      nearby branch. The bird, no bigger than her thumb, sings a tiny melody and hops in a little
      dance, completely unselfconscious. Its movement is imperfect but joyful, pure and free.
      One wilted flower beneath the bird's branch perks up slightly, responding to the simple
      authentic expression. Elise's eyes focus on this, her expression shifting from defeat to
      quiet recognition. A single golden thread near the bird begins to glow faintly. The shadows
      pause their advance. The tiniest spark of hope flickers in Elise's eyes.

      A bird smaller than her thumb landed on a branch nearby. It hopped and chirped. Its silly little dance, unafraid of looking foolish. Just itself, completely. One flower beneath it brightened, just a bit. Elise watched. "Even you?" she whispered. Even the smallest truth mattered. She stood slow. The performance hall waited.
