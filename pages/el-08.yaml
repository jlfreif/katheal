      Elise dances frantically through an enormous garden stretching to the horizon,
      thousands of grey flowers and colorless trees everywhere. She spins from flower
      to flower, arms reaching, movements becoming less graceful and more desperate.
      Her hair flies wildly. Sweat shows on her face. The scale is overwhelming—paths
      wind endlessly through grey flowerbeds. The sky above is overcast and heavy.

      The garden stretched forever. Thousands of flowers, all grey. Elise spun from
      bloom to bloom, dancing as fast as she could, trying to restore them all. Her
      gentle approach had worked on a few flowers, but looking at this vast emptiness,
      those few felt like nothing. So she danced harder, faster, pushing herself to
      cover more ground.

    visual: |
      Elise has collapsed on the ground, lying on her side among grey flowers, completely
      exhausted. Her arms are sprawled out, unable to move. Tears slide down her cheeks.
      Her dance has stopped—her body gave out. In the near foreground, one small flower
      retains a hint of color from her earlier touch, but she's too defeated to notice.
      The garden stretches endlessly behind her, untouched.

      Her legs gave out. Elise collapsed on the ground, too exhausted to move, tears
      sliding down her cheeks. She'd tried to dance through the whole garden. Tried
      to be big enough, fast enough, strong enough. But she was too small. Too gentle.
      Too slow. How could one nine-year-old who just danced quietly possibly matter
      against all this grey?
