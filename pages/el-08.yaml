    visual: |
      Elise stands at the edge of an enormous garden stretching to the horizon,
      thousands of flowers, bushes, and trees all drained of color, rendered in
      shades of grey and pale ash. Elegant paths wind through colorless flowerbeds.
      A fountain flows with grey water in the distance. The sky above is overcast
      and heavy. The scale is overwhelming.

      The garden stretched forever. Thousands of flowers, all grey. Trees that
      should have shimmered stood like pencil sketches waiting for color that would
      never come. Elise's careful, gentle approach had restored a few blooms. A
      few. Looking at this vast emptiness, those few felt like nothing at all.

    focus: Inner doubt and discouragement

    visual: |
      Elise stands very still, arms wrapped around herself in a self-protective hug,
      chin tucked down. Her watercolor set lies fallen on the ground beside her feet.
      Tears glisten on her cheeks, quiet crying showing deep sadness. In the near
      foreground, one small flower retains a hint of color, but she hasn't noticed it.

      Elise wrapped her arms around herself, trying to hold the pieces together.
      Tears slid down her cheeks, quiet and unstoppable. She was too small. Too
      gentle. Too slow. How could one nine-year-old who just noticed things possibly
      matter against all this grey? Her watercolor set lay forgotten at her feet,
      its colors seeming foolish now.
