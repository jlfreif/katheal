      A darkening grove where Elise sits slumped against a tree trunk, legs drawn up, arms wrapped
      around her knees. Her usually graceful posture is collapsed and heavy. Around her, the
      flowers she helped revive earlier are wilting again, their colors fading. Golden threads
      that once danced in the air now lie limp on the ground. Shadows creep closer from the
      forest edges. Her dance shoes are dusty and worn. Her face shows deep exhaustion, eyes
      half-closed, expression defeated. The grove that was once bright with her authentic expression
      now dims back toward grey. The atmosphere weighs heavy with failure and fading hope.

      Elise ran to the distant grove but arrived too late. Elise couldn't move anymore. Every dance she'd performed was fading back to grey. The flowers wilted again, drooping. The threads lay still on the forest floor. "I tried so hard," she said to the empty grove. It wasn't enough. Nothing was enough.

      Elise still slumped against the tree, but her head is turned to watch a small bird on a
      nearby branch. The bird, no bigger than her thumb, sings a tiny melody and hops in a little
      dance, completely unselfconscious. Its movement is imperfect but joyful, pure and free.
      One wilted flower beneath the bird's branch perks up slightly, responding to the simple
      authentic expression. Elise's eyes focus on this, her expression shifting from defeat to
      quiet recognition. A single golden thread near the bird begins to glow faintly. The shadows
      pause their advance. The tiniest spark of hope flickers in Elise's eyes.

      A bird smaller than her thumb landed nearby on a branch. It hopped. It chirped its silly little dance, unafraid. One flower beneath it brightened, just a bit. The bird wasn't afraid of looking foolish. Just itself, completely. "Even you?" Elise whispered. That mattered too. Even the smallest truth mattered. Elise stood slowly.
