      Ellie taps out her rhythm on one central stone—her hands moving confidently in the pattern
      she heard: tap, pause, tap-tap, pause, tap-tap-tap. As she taps, Noah presses the stones in
      sequence following his map pattern. The stones light up in response—golden light flowing
      from Ellie's stone to Noah's stones in perfect synchronization. Both siblings lean forward,
      intent, working together without words. The music grows more beautiful, more whole.

      Ellie tapped. Noah pressed. The stones sang together, golden light flowing between them.
      "It's working!" Ellie laughed. Noah felt something click into place—not just in the puzzle,
      but in his understanding.

      The ground trembles gently. Behind the spiral of Singing Stones, a massive archway covered
      in flowering vines reveals itself—previously hidden, now glowing with the same golden light.
      The archway frames a new path forward, mysterious but inviting. Noah and Ellie stand side
      by side, victorious, their hands still glowing faintly. Ellie grins proudly. Noah's expression
      shows revelation—he couldn't have done this alone, and that's not a weakness.

      A hidden archway bloomed to life, vines parting like a curtain. Noah stared at Ellie,
      amazed. "I could never have solved that alone." Ellie squeezed his hand. "That's what
      makes it better."
