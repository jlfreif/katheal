    visual: |
      Elise's room looks exactly the same as the opening: drawings on the wall, art
      supplies on her desk, mirror reflecting the afternoon light. But Elise herself
      is different. She stands in front of her mirror again, beginning a slow dance,
      but this time her movements carry a new confidence. The starlight paintbrush
      glows softly in her pocket. Her expression is peaceful, centered, sure.

      Elise's room looked exactly the same: drawings on the wall, art supplies
      scattered in their familiar mess, mirror reflecting the afternoon light.
      But when she stood in front of the mirror and began to dance, something was
      different. She moved with the same gentle grace, but now she knew—truly
      knew—that her quiet way mattered.

    focus: Transformed by the journey

    visual: |
      Elise dances in front of her mirror with flowing, graceful movements, arms
      extended in a lyrical gesture. As she moves, faint golden light trails from
      her fingertips, dancing with her. The drawings on the wall behind her show
      a subtle glow. Outside the window, a butterfly with faintly luminescent wings
      watches. Her reflection shows both who she was and who she's become—the same,
      but more fully herself.

      She spun slowly, arms flowing like water, and watched herself in the mirror.
      The same girl. The same gentle movements. But now she understood that flowing
      could be as powerful as forcing, that quiet could change the world. Her dance
      was exactly enough. Outside her window, an ordinary butterfly sat on the sill,
      its wings catching light. Elise smiled and kept dancing.
