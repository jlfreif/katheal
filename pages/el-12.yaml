      Elise's bedroom, the same mirror and space as the opening, but seen differently now.
      Afternoon light still streams through the window. Elise stands before the mirror, the
      blue pendant visible around her neck, pulsing gently. She's in the same starting position
      as the first page, but her posture is different—more relaxed, more centered, more herself.
      Her expression shows quiet confidence. Golden threads shimmer faintly in the mirror's
      reflection, a reminder of where she's been. Her stuffed animals seem to watch with knowing
      smiles. The room feels simultaneously familiar and transformed, ordinary but touched by magic.

      The path led back through the mirror to her room. Her room looked the same. Same mirror reflecting back. Same posters on the walls. Same light streaming through. But she wasn't the same. The pendant glowed beneath her shirt, a secret reminder. She lifted her arms, ready to dance again.

      Elise dances with complete freedom and joy, spinning across her room with abandon. Her
      hair flies out, her movements are both graceful and wild, perfectly technical and wonderfully
      silly. She laughs as she dances. In the mirror, golden threads appear faintly, dancing
      with her—a connection to Kathaél that hasn't faded. The pendant glows bright. Her whole
      being radiates confidence and authentic expression. Small sparkles of light drift through
      her ordinary room like magic leaking through. Her expression shows pure happiness, centered
      in who she truly is. The scene feels triumphant but grounded, magical but real.

      Elise spun and leaped and added a silly wiggle because it felt right. In the mirror, golden threads danced with her, faint but real. Kathaél lived in every authentic choice she made. She laughed, throwing her arms wide. "This is my magic. This is my courage. This is enough."
