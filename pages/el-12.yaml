    visual: |
      Elise's bedroom, the same mirror and space as the opening, but seen differently now.
      Afternoon light still streams through the window. Elise stands before the mirror, watching
      as the golden threads fade from view, the forest path closing behind her reflection. She's
      back in the same starting position as the first page, but her posture is different—more
      relaxed, more centered, more herself. Her expression shows quiet confidence. The mirror
      reflects just her now, but she can still feel the warmth of where she's been. Her stuffed
      animals seem to watch with knowing smiles. The room feels simultaneously familiar and
      transformed, ordinary but touched by magic.

      The golden threads led them back. Through the forest. Through the mirror. Elise stepped into her room. Everything looked the same. Same mirror. Same posters. Same light. But she wasn't the same. The golden wristband pulsed softly on her wrist, glowing blue. She lifted her arms to the mirror. Ready to dance again.

    focus: Transformed by the journey
    visual: |
      Elise dances with newfound power and freedom, moving across her room with abandon. Her
      movements are sharper, stronger, more confident than before—powerful technique mixed with
      pure joy. She nails a triple spin that she couldn't do before, then adds a silly wiggle.
      She laughs as she dances. The golden wristband on her wrist glows softly with blue light.
      In the mirror, golden threads appear faintly for just a moment, dancing with her—a connection
      to Kathaél that hasn't faded. Her whole being radiates strength and joy. Small sparkles of
      light drift through her ordinary room like magic leaking through. Her expression shows pure
      happiness and confidence. The scene feels triumphant but grounded, magical but real.

      Elise spun—triple rotation, perfect—then added a silly wiggle because it felt right. Stronger now. More powerful. The golden wristband glowed on her wrist. In the mirror, golden threads danced with her for just a heartbeat, then faded. Kathaél lived in every choice—technique plus joy. She laughed, throwing her arms wide. "This is my courage."
