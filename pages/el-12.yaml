    visual: |
      Elise's bedroom, the same mirror and space as the opening, but seen differently now. Afternoon
      light still streams through the window. Elise stands before the mirror, watching as golden
      threads fade from view, the Library closing behind her reflection. She's back in the same
      starting position as the first page, but her posture is different—more relaxed, more centered,
      more herself. Her expression shows quiet confidence. The mirror reflects just her now, but she
      can still feel the warmth of where she's been. The golden wristband pulses softly on her wrist,
      glowing blue. Her stuffed animals seem to watch with knowing smiles. The room feels
      simultaneously familiar and transformed, ordinary but touched by magic. Text in Times New Roman

      The golden threads led them back. Through the Library. Through ancient trees with books on branches. Through the mirror. Elise stepped into her room. Everything looked the same. Same mirror. Same posters. Same light. But she wasn't the same. The golden wristband pulsed softly on her wrist, glowing blue. She lifted her arms to the mirror. Ready to dance again.

      Elise dances with newfound power and freedom, moving across her room with abandon. Her
      movements are sharper, stronger, more confident than before—powerful technique mixed with pure
      joy. She nails a triple spin that she couldn't do before, then adds a silly wiggle. She laughs
      as she dances. The golden wristband on her wrist glows softly with blue light. In the mirror,
      golden threads appear faintly for just a moment, dancing with her—a connection to the Library
      that hasn't faded. Musical notes shimmer briefly in the air, echoes of her pedestal. Her whole
      being radiates strength and joy. Small sparkles of light drift through her ordinary room like
      magic leaking through. Her expression shows pure happiness and confidence. The scene feels
      triumphant but grounded, magical but real. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at

      Elise spun—triple rotation, perfect—then added a silly wiggle because it felt right. Stronger now. More powerful. The golden wristband glowed on her wrist. In the mirror, golden threads danced with her for just a heartbeat, then faded. The Library lived in every choice—technique plus joy. She laughed, throwing her arms wide. "This is my courage."
