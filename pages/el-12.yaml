      Elise's bedroom, the same mirror and space as the opening, but seen differently now.
      Afternoon light still streams through the window. Elise stands before the mirror, watching
      as the golden threads fade from view, the forest path closing behind her reflection. She's
      back in the same starting position as the first page, but her posture is different—more
      relaxed, more centered, more herself. Her expression shows quiet confidence. The mirror
      reflects just her now, but she can still feel the warmth of where she's been. Her stuffed
      animals seem to watch with knowing smiles. The room feels simultaneously familiar and
      transformed, ordinary but touched by magic.

      The golden threads led them back. Through the forest. Through the mirror. Elise stepped into her room. Everything looked the same. Same mirror. Same posters. Same light. But she wasn't the same. She lifted her arms to the mirror. Ready to dance again.

      Elise dances with complete freedom and joy, moving across her room with abandon. Her
      hair flies out, her movements are both powerful and wild, sharply controlled and wonderfully
      silly. She laughs as she dances. In the mirror, golden threads appear faintly for just a
      moment, dancing with her—a connection to Kathaél that hasn't faded. Her whole being radiates
      confidence and authentic expression. Small sparkles of light drift through her ordinary
      room like magic leaking through. Her expression shows pure happiness, centered in who she
      truly is. The scene feels triumphant but grounded, magical but real.

      Elise spun and leaped and added a silly wiggle because it felt right. In the mirror, golden threads danced with her for just a heartbeat, then faded. Kathaél lived in every authentic choice. She laughed, throwing her arms wide. "This is my magic. This is my courage. This is enough."
