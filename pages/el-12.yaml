    visual: |
      Elise sits at her small desk in the same position as the opening, drawing
      with focused joy. The colored pencil in her hand carries a faint shimmer.
      Her watercolor set sits open on the desk, one paintbrush glowing subtly with
      golden light. Her expression is peaceful and content, posture relaxed and
      confident in a new way.

      Elise's room looked exactly the same: desk by the window, drawings on the
      wall, art supplies scattered in their familiar mess. But when she picked up
      her colored pencils, she felt the starlight paintbrush humming in her pocket.
      She began to draw, and this time, she drew differently.

    focus: Transformed by the journey

    visual: |
      Elise's drawing shows a meadow full of flowers in gentle, beautiful colors,
      and every flower on the page glows softly with its own light. On the wall
      behind her, her other drawings have begun to show the same subtle glow.
      Outside, a butterfly with faintly luminescent wings rests on the windowsill,
      watching her draw.

      Every flower she drew seemed to glow, just a little. Not magic. Just attention.
      Elise noticed every color, every shadow, every small thing that mattered.
      Outside her window, an ordinary butterfly sat on the sill, its wings catching
      light in a way that might have been magical. Elise smiled. Her gentle way of
      seeing was exactly enough.
