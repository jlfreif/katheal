    visual: |
      Elise's bedroom, the same mirror and space as the opening, but seen differently now.
      Afternoon light still streams through the window. Elise stands before the mirror, the
      blue pendant visible around her neck, pulsing gently. She's in the same starting position
      as the first page, but her posture is different—more relaxed, more centered, more herself.
      Her expression shows quiet confidence. Golden threads shimmer faintly in the mirror's
      reflection, a reminder of where she's been. Her stuffed animals seem to watch with knowing
      smiles. The room feels simultaneously familiar and transformed, ordinary but touched by magic.

      Elise stood in her room, the mirror reflecting her familiar space. Same dance floor, same
      posters, same afternoon light. But she wasn't the same. The pendant glowed warm beneath her
      shirt, a secret reminder of Kathaél. She lifted her arms into position, ready to dance.
      The difference was inside her now—a certainty that being herself, exactly as she was, was
      the most important performance she'd ever give.

      Elise dances with complete freedom and joy, spinning across her room with abandon. Her
      hair flies out, her movements are both graceful and wild, perfectly technical and wonderfully
      silly. She laughs as she dances. In the mirror, golden threads appear faintly, dancing
      with her—a connection to Kathaél that hasn't faded. The pendant glows bright. Her whole
      being radiates confidence and authentic expression. Small sparkles of light drift through
      her ordinary room like magic leaking through. Her expression shows pure happiness, centered
      in who she truly is. The scene feels triumphant but grounded, magical but real.

      Elise spun and leaped, adding a silly wiggle just because it felt right. She sang out loud,
      making up words, not caring if they rhymed. In the mirror, golden threads danced with her,
      faint but real. Kathaél hadn't disappeared. It lived in every authentic choice, every
      moment she chose to be herself. She laughed, arms thrown wide, and the pendant blazed
      brilliant blue. This was her magic. This was her courage. This was enough.
