      Noah's desk in his room, covered with notebooks, loose papers, and sticky notes. Noah (12
      years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue hoodie and tan sport
      pants) hunches over his laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard. Multiple browser tabs
      show research for his story. Crumpled papers surround his wastebasket showing crossed-out
      attempts. His ukulele leans against the desk. Bookshelves line the walls, stuffed with
      adventure novels. His expression shows intense concentration mixed with frustration. The
      room is cluttered but organized in his own system. Late afternoon light streams through
      the window.

      Noah stared at the blinking cursor, willing the right words to appear. He'd rewritten this ending seventeen times. None of them felt right. Each version sat crumpled in the wastebasket, proof that knowing a story needed an ending didn't mean knowing what that ending should be.

      Noah's laptop screen glitches, pixels rearranging into golden threads that seem to flow
      out of the screen into the real world. Noah leans back in his chair, eyes wide, watching
      as the golden threads weave through the air between him and the laptop, forming words
      that shimmer: "Some stories need living, not writing." The threads pulse with warm light,
      beckoning. His notebooks flutter their pages despite no breeze. One thread reaches toward
      his hand as if inviting him to grab it. His expression shifts from frustration to amazed
      curiosity. The atmosphere crackles with unexpected possibility.

      The screen flickered. Golden threads poured from his laptop into the real world, weaving through the air like liquid light. Words formed in the threads. "Some stories need living, not writing." Noah's analytical mind tried to make sense of it, but the threads didn't wait for logic. One curled around his wrist, warm and insistent, pulling gently toward somewhere his room couldn't reach.
