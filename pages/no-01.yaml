      Noah's desk covered with detailed outlines, character charts, plot diagrams, and color-coded
      sticky notes. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue
      hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) types on his laptop while consulting multiple
      notebooks. Each character has a full backstory. Every scene is planned. Every dialogue mapped.
      His ukulele leans against the desk. Bookshelves line the walls. His face shows intense focus
      and satisfaction—everything is planned perfectly. The atmosphere is organized precision. Text
      in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom of page.

      Noah checked his outline. Chapter three, scene two, paragraph five. Everything planned. Every character doing exactly what they should. He smiled. Get it right the first time. That's what made a perfect story.

      On Noah's laptop screen, words begin appearing on their own. His characters are writing
      dialogue he didn't plan. "Wait, I didn't write that," he mutters, hitting backspace. But
      more words appear, faster now. His main character takes a turn he didn't outline. A side
      character speaks up unexpectedly. Golden threads pour from the screen. His notebooks flutter
      despite no breeze. The outline pages start rearranging themselves. His expression shifts from
      certainty to alarm. The atmosphere crackles with stories taking on life of their own. Text in
      Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom.

      Words appeared on screen. But Noah wasn't typing them. His characters were writing themselves, going off-outline. "No no no," he muttered, deleting frantically. But they kept writing. Golden threads poured out. A voice whispered: "Some stories need more than one try to get right."
