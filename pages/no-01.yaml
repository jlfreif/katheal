description: Noah sits at his desk, overwhelmed by choices, when something catches his eye through the window—leading him to discover an ancient compass at the forest's edge.

  Noah holds the Cartographer's Compass up to the light at the edge of the Whispering Woods.
  The compass is ornate—brass outer ring with intricate engravings, a crystal face that swirls
  with faint golden mist, and a needle that shimmers between blue and gold. His eyes are wide
  with wonder, mouth slightly open. The needle spins wildly for a moment, then points directly
  into the darkest, most mysterious part of the woods. Behind him, the safe, sunny meadow
  contrasts with the shadowy forest ahead.

  Noah stared at three different story beginnings, unable to choose which one to finish.
  Something golden flashed at the edge of the woods—sharp and bright, like a signal meant
  just for him. At the forest's edge, he found it: a compass made of tarnished brass and
  crystal, half-buried like it had been waiting centuries. The needle spun once, twice,
  then locked onto a direction—straight into the deepest part of the woods. This wasn't
  pointing to anywhere safe. But something about it felt...right.
