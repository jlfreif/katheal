      Noah sits cross-legged on his bedroom floor, surrounded by crumpled papers
      and notebooks filled with crossed-out lines. He holds a pen poised over yet
      another ending, brow furrowed in frustration. Three different drafts of the
      same story lie open around him. A ukulele leans forgotten against the wall.

      Noah crossed out another ending. Too predictable. He tried again: "And then
      they lived—" No. Too easy. He'd rewritten this story eleven times, and nothing
      felt right. Every ending he wrote seemed to close something that wanted to
      stay open. His pen hovered, stuck between words.

    focus: First hint of something different

    visual: |
      Noah's head lifts sharply, pen frozen mid-stroke. At his window, a single
      golden thread floats in the air, its end trailing off into nothing—unfinished,
      like a sentence without a period. The thread pulses gently, as if waiting for
      something. His notebook lies forgotten in his lap.

      A shimmer caught his eye. Noah turned and saw a thread of golden light
      hovering by his window, thin and bright. But the strange thing was its end:
      it just stopped, trailing into nothing, like a story interrupted mid-word.
      His heart beat faster. Something unfinished was calling to him.
