      Noah's desk covered with notebooks and crumpled papers. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond
      voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) hunches
      over his laptop, typing fast. His wastebasket overflows with crossed-out attempts. Ukulele
      leans against the desk. Bookshelves stuffed with adventure novels line the walls. His face
      shows intense focus mixed with frustration. Late afternoon light through the window. Text
      in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom of page.

      Noah stared at the blinking cursor. Seventeen endings. All wrong. The wastebasket overflowed with failures. He knew the story needed an ending. He just didn't know what that ending should be.

      Noah's laptop screen glitches. Golden threads pour from the screen into the real world,
      weaving through the air. Noah leans back, eyes wide. The threads form glowing words: "Some
      stories need living, not writing." One thread reaches toward his hand, beckoning. His
      notebooks flutter despite no breeze. His expression shifts from frustration to wonder.
      The air crackles with magic. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom.

      The screen flickered. Golden threads poured out. They wove through the air like light made liquid. Words formed: "Some stories need living, not writing." One thread curled around his wrist. Warm. Insistent. Pulling him somewhere impossible.
