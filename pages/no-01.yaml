      Noah sits cross-legged on his bedroom floor, surrounded by crumpled papers.
      His notebook shows crossed-out lines and margin notes. He holds a pen above
      another failed ending, brow furrowed. A ukulele leans forgotten against
      his wall. Late afternoon light streams through his window.

      "And they lived happily..." Noah scratched out the words. Too easy.
      He flipped to a fresh page and tried again. "The hero discovered..."
      No. Still wrong. He groaned and tossed the notebook aside. "Why can't
      I just finish one story?" Every ending he wrote felt like a door
      slamming shut on something that wanted to stay open.

    visual: |
      Noah's head snaps up toward his window. A single golden thread floats
      in the air, its end frayed and flickering like a candle about to die.
      The thread pulses urgently, trailing off into nothing. His notebook
      lies forgotten on the floor beside him.

      A shimmer caught his eye. At the window, a thread of golden light
      hovered, thin and bright. But something was wrong with it. The end
      flickered weakly, fraying like a rope about to snap. "That's not
      supposed to happen," Noah whispered. He reached toward it, and the
      thread pulsed warmer, tugging gently. It wrapped around his wrist
      like it was asking—no, needing—his help.
