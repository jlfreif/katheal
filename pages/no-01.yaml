      Noah's bedroom filled with adventure books, climbing gear hanging on hooks, basketball trophies
      on a shelf. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue
      hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) sits cross-legged on his bed surrounded by the pieces
      of an elaborate puzzle-box. His notebook shows diagrams and failed attempts. He's been working
      on this for days—rotating pieces, testing combinations, trying different sequences. His face
      shows intense focus and determination. His ukulele leans against the nightstand. The atmosphere
      is excited problem-solving energy. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom

      Noah twisted the outer ring left, then the middle ring right, then pressed the copper plate. Click. Nothing. He checked his notebook—attempt forty-seven failed. He grinned and reached for the box again. "Okay, what if I..." He tried a new sequence, fingers flying over the intricate mechanisms.

      The puzzle-box suddenly clicks open in Noah's hands. Golden light erupts from inside, and
      threads pour out like living things—wrapping around his wrists, humming with energy. He jumps
      to his feet as the threads pull toward his window. Books rustle on shelves. His climbing gear
      rattles. The threads aren't forcing him—they're inviting him, tugging gently but insistently.
      Through the window, he glimpses towering trees that shouldn't be there. His expression shows
      surprise shifting to excitement—this is the kind of adventure he's always read about. The
      atmosphere crackles with possibility. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at

      The final piece rotated into place. The box sprang open. Golden threads exploded out, wrapping warm around Noah's wrists. They tugged toward the window—gentle but urgent. Through the glass, impossible trees rose against the sky. His heart hammered. This was it. Real adventure. He grabbed his hoodie. "Let's go."
