      Noah's bedroom. Adventure books line the shelves. Climbing gear hangs on hooks. Basketball
      trophies on a shelf. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, blue
      hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) sits at his desk with a Rubik's cube in one hand,
      laptop open showing a video chat. He's laughing, mid-conversation. His notebook shows board
      game designs with intricate puzzle mechanics. A finished cube sits beside three others. His
      ukulele leans against the nightstand. The atmosphere is energetic and social. Text in Times

      Noah twisted the Rubik's cube. Click-click-click. Done. "Forty-seven seconds!" His friend groaned through the laptop. "Show-off." Noah grinned. "It's all patterns. Once you see them, they're easy." He grabbed his notebook. His board game design was almost finished. He loved creating puzzles for people to solve.

      Golden threads suddenly weave through Noah's room. They float in the air, arranging themselves
      into patterns. Constellation symbols. Mathematical sequences. Word riddles. Musical notes.
      Physical mechanisms. Five different puzzle types swirling together. The threads form glowing
      text: "THE LIBRARY OF KATHAÉL NEEDS SOLVERS." More threads create a shimmering doorway
      of golden light. Noah stands, eyes wide with excitement. His puzzle-brain already engaging.
      The atmosphere crackles with challenge and invitation. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white
