  Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build) sits cross-legged
  on his bedroom floor, surrounded by scattered notebooks, loose papers covered in
  his handwriting, and a few paperback books. He holds a pen in his right hand,
  poised over an open notebook, but his gaze is directed out the window to his left.
  His expression is thoughtful and slightly wistful—longing for something beyond what
  he can see. The room is cozy but ordinary: a bed with a blue quilt, a small desk
  with more books stacked on it, and a ukulele leaning against the wall. Afternoon
  light streams through the window, creating a warm glow on the wooden floor. Through
  the window, there's a glimpse of ordinary suburban trees and sky, but at the very
  edge of the window frame, barely visible, is a shimmer of golden light that doesn't
  quite belong—like a thread of something magical just entering his world. Noah hasn't
  noticed it yet. A half-written story is visible on the page in front of him, with
  several crossed-out lines.

  Noah wrote stories about brave heroes, but wished he could have a real adventure of his own. Something that mattered.
