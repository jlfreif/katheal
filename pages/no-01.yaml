    visual: |
      Noah sits cross-legged on his bedroom floor, surrounded by scattered notebooks
      and paperback books. He holds a pen poised over an open notebook, but his gaze
      drifts toward the window. Afternoon light creates warm patches on the wooden
      floor. A ukulele leans against the wall beside his desk.

      Noah stared at the half-written story in his lap, but the words felt flat.
      Outside his window, the same trees swayed in the same breeze as yesterday and
      the day before. His pen tapped against the paper. He wrote about heroes and
      adventures, but sitting here in his ordinary room, those stories felt like
      wishes that would never come true.

    focus: First hint of something different

    visual: |
      Noah's head turns sharply toward the window, eyes widening. At the edge of the
      window frame, a single golden thread floats in the air, shimmering with soft
      light that doesn't match the afternoon sun. His pen hovers forgotten above the
      page. The thread pulses gently, as if breathing.

      A flicker of gold caught his eye. Noah turned and saw something impossible: a
      thread of light hovering just outside his window, thin as spider silk but
      glowing like a tiny sun. It swayed without any breeze. His notebook slid from
      his lap as he scrambled to his feet, heart suddenly pounding.
