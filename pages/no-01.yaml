      Noah's bedroom filled with adventure books, climbing gear hanging on hooks, basketball trophies
      on a shelf. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue
      hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) sits at his desk typing furiously. His screen shows
      a story about a hero solving a puzzle. The hero tries the lock—it opens perfectly. First try.
      Noah nods with satisfaction. His notebook has crossed-out scenes: "Hero tries wrong path,"
      "Character makes mistake," "Failed attempt." All deleted. On his wall, a poster says "Get it
      right the first time." His expression shows intense focus and perfectionist satisfaction. His
      recycle bin is full of "messy" story drafts. The atmosphere is controlled precision. Text in

      Noah typed: "The hero grabbed the lock and solved it perfectly." Delete. Too vague. "The hero analyzed the puzzle and unlocked it on the first attempt." Better. No messy failures. No wrong turns. His characters always knew exactly what to do. He scrolled up, found a scene where someone hesitated. Delete. Heroes don't hesitate. Get it right the first time. That's what makes a good story.

      Noah's laptop screen suddenly glitches. The words of his perfect story start writhing,
      rearranging themselves. Text he deleted reappears: "The hero tried and failed." "She took the
      wrong path." "He made a mistake." Noah frantically hits delete but the words won't go away.
      More appear: "LET US FAIL" "LET US TRY" "WE'RE SUFFOCATING." The screen cracks with golden
      light. His stories are screaming. Golden threads pour out—not inviting, but desperate,
      grasping. They wrap around his wrists and yank hard. Through the screen he sees a forest
      library, but books are withering, pages blackening, stories gasping. His expression shifts
      from control to alarm—his stories are in pain. The atmosphere is desperate emergency. Text in

      The screen blazed. Words Noah had deleted rewrote themselves: "The hero failed." "She tried again." "He made a mistake—" Noah jabbed delete. The words stayed. More appeared, faster: "LET US BREATHE" "LET US FAIL" "WE'RE DYING." Golden threads exploded from the screen, wrapping tight around his wrists. Not gentle. Desperate. Yanking him toward a forest library where books were turning to ash. "Wait—" Too late. The threads pulled him through.
