      Noah's bedroom filled with adventure books, climbing gear hanging on hooks, basketball trophies
      on a shelf. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue
      hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) sits at his desk typing on his laptop. His notebook
      is open beside him filled with sketches of puzzle mechanisms, a collapsing magical library,
      and an adventurer solving locks. He's been working on this story for weeks—a hero racing
      through a crumbling forest library, solving intricate puzzle-locks to free trapped stories.
      But he's stuck. How should the puzzles actually work? What makes them hard enough to be
      exciting? His face shows intense focus mixed with frustration. His ukulele leans against the
      nightstand. The atmosphere is creative problem-solving energy. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      Noah stared at his screen. "The hero grabbed the puzzle-lock and..." And what? How did it work? He'd drawn rotating rings, constellation symbols, pressure plates. But how did they fit together? He wanted the puzzle to be actually hard, not just described as hard. He tried again: "The rings rotated and clicked..." Ugh. He deleted it. Attempt forty-seven at this scene. Still not right.

      Golden threads suddenly pour out of Noah's laptop screen—erupting from the words of his
      story like living things. They wrap around his wrists, warm and humming with energy. His
      adventure story glows on the screen, the words pulsing with light. More threads emerge,
      tugging him gently but insistently toward the screen. Through his monitor, instead of his
      document, he glimpses towering trees and stone archways—the forest library from his story,
      real and tangible. Books rustle on his shelves. His climbing gear rattles. His expression
      shows shock shifting to wonder—his story world is real? The threads pull stronger. The
      atmosphere crackles with impossible possibility. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white

      Golden threads exploded from the screen—from his own words. They wrapped warm around Noah's wrists, tugging insistently. Through the monitor, he saw it: the forest library from his story. Not imagined. Real. The trees he'd described, the stone archways, the shimmering barriers. His heart hammered. His story was real. The threads pulled harder. "Okay," he breathed. "Let's go."
