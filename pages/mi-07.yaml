    focus: Fun action scene with creature
    visual: |
      A creature made of wind and golden branches blocks the path to the next platform course.
      It's dynamic and beautiful—constantly shifting between lightning-fast movement and complete
      stillness. The creature lunges at Micah with whip-quick tendrils. Micah dodges left, rolls,
      comes up running. The creature freezes completely still. Micah mirrors it, freezing too.
      Then it bursts forward again. Micah's expression shows intense focus and excitement—this is
      the most intense game of freeze tag ever. His body is in dynamic motion, showing his parkour
      skills. The atmosphere is high-energy action, fun and challenging, like a dance battle.

      A creature made of wind and golden branches blocked the next course. It moved in bursts—lightning fast, then completely still. It lunged at Micah. He dodged, rolled, came up running. It froze. He froze. It burst forward again. Micah mirrored it, moving when it moved, pausing when it paused. This was the most intense game of freeze tag he'd ever played.

    focus: Victory but tired, meeting Maya
    visual: |
      Micah matches the creature's rhythm perfectly—sprint, freeze, sprint, freeze—until he
      reaches its glowing center crystal. He touches it and the creature dissolves into peaceful
      golden light. A girl with dark curly hair (Maya) stands behind where the creature was,
      grinning and impressed. Micah is breathing hard, hands on his knees, clearly exhausted but
      triumphant. His expression shows tired satisfaction—he won but it took effort. Maya looks
      energetic and friendly. The atmosphere shows victory earned through genuine effort, plus
      the warmth of a new friendship.

      Micah matched the creature's rhythm—sprint, freeze, sprint, freeze. He reached its center and touched the glowing crystal there. The creature dissolved into light, peaceful. A girl with dark curly hair stood behind where it had been. "Nice moves!" Maya said, grinning. "I'm Maya." Micah was breathing hard, hands on his knees. "Micah. And that was EXHAUSTING. Did NOT expect a boss battle in a magical forest today." Maya laughed.
