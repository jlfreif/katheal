    focus: Fun action scene with creature
    visual: |
      A guardian made of wind and golden gears blocks the path through the Library's mechanical chamber.
      It's dynamic and beautiful—constantly shifting between lightning-fast movement and complete
      stillness. The guardian lunges at Micah with whip-quick gear-tendrils. Micah dodges left, rolls,
      comes up running. The guardian freezes completely still. Micah mirrors it, freezing too. Then it
      bursts forward again. Micah's expression shows intense focus and excitement—this is the most
      intense game of freeze tag ever. His body is in dynamic motion mid-dodge, showing his parkour
      skills. The atmosphere is high-energy action, fun and challenging, like a dance battle. Text in

      A guardian made of wind and golden gears blocked the next course. It moved in bursts—lightning fast, then completely still. It lunged at Micah. He dodged, rolled, came up running. It froze. He froze. It burst forward again. Micah mirrored it, moving when it moved, pausing when it paused. This was the most intense game of freeze tag he'd ever played.

    focus: Victory but tired
    visual: |
      Micah matches the guardian's rhythm perfectly—sprint, freeze, sprint, freeze—until he reaches
      its glowing center crystal. He touches it and the guardian dissolves into peaceful golden light
      that flows back into the Library's mechanisms. Micah is breathing hard, hands on his knees,
      clearly exhausted but triumphant. His expression shows tired satisfaction—he won but it took
      effort. Through the archway ahead, the physical mechanisms pedestal glows in its chamber, waiting
      for him. But he needs to catch his breath first. Books flutter approvingly around him. The
      atmosphere shows victory earned through genuine effort. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white
      space at bottom.

      Micah matched the guardian's rhythm—sprint, freeze, sprint, freeze. He reached its center and touched the glowing crystal there. The guardian dissolved into light, peaceful. Micah dropped to his hands and knees, breathing hard. Completely exhausted. "Did NOT expect a boss battle in a magical library today," he muttered, grinning. But ahead, the physical mechanisms pedestal glowed, calling him forward. Almost there.
