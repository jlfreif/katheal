      Micah climbs steadily up the cliff face, using his new technique. Eyes on the next hold.
      Focus ahead, not below. He moves with growing confidence, reaching higher than he's ever
      been. Twenty feet up. Thirty feet. Forty. The cliff glows golden as he climbs, celebrating
      his courage. Other creatures watch in admiration. His movements are strong and sure. His
      expression shows focused determination and growing pride. The atmosphere celebrates
      approaching success—he's almost conquered this.

      Micah climbed higher than he'd ever been. Twenty feet. Thirty. Forty. Eyes forward, not down. One handhold, then the next. The cliff blazed gold. He was doing it. Really doing it. Almost to the top.

    focus: Realizing something is missing
    visual: |
      Near the cliff's summit, Micah reaches for the next hold and there isn't one—just smooth
      rock for several feet. To continue, he has to edge along a narrow ledge completely exposed,
      nothing above to grab. The wind picks up. Before he can stop himself, his eyes go DOWN,
      seeing all that empty space below. The full height hits him. Forty feet of nothing. His
      courage breaks. He freezes, pressed against the wall, unable to edge across the exposed
      section. So close to the top but stuck. His expression shows terrified frustration. The
      atmosphere shows the gap between almost and complete.

      Then the cliff changed. No handholds above. Just a narrow ledge, completely exposed. The wind pushed. Micah's eyes went down. All that height. All that empty space. His courage cracked. He froze. So close to the top. But stuck. Knowing how wasn't enough. He needed to trust it when it got really scary.
