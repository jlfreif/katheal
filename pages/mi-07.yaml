      Micah moves through the garden combining breath with motion—each jump punctuated by pause,
      each movement preceded by centered breath. He flows beautifully from platform to platform,
      golden light trailing his movements. Breath, leap. Pause, roll. Center, vault. His movements
      are more powerful and graceful than ever before because they come from stillness rather
      than chaos. The garden glows in response. Other creatures watch in awe. His expression shows
      focused joy. The atmosphere celebrates this new integrated approach—almost perfected.

      Micah moved through the garden in a new way. Breathe, then leap. Pause, then vault. Center, then climb. Each movement came from stillness. He was faster than before, stronger, more graceful. The garden glowed bright. So close to mastering it.

    focus: Realizing something is missing
    visual: |
      At the crucial final moment, Micah gets excited and forgets to breathe, falling back into
      frantic motion. He stumbles, loses his balance, falls awkwardly. The golden light flickers
      and dims. He sits on the ground frustrated, realizing he almost had it but his old habits
      kicked in right when it mattered most. The garden waits patiently but doesn't glow. His
      expression shows frustrated understanding—knowing what to do isn't the same as doing it
      when it counts. The atmosphere shows the gap between almost and complete.

      At the final jump, Micah got excited and forgot. Forgot to breathe. Fell back into frantic motion. He stumbled and fell. The light dimmed. He knew how to breathe and pause. But when things got intense, his body defaulted back to chaos. Knowing wasn't enough.
