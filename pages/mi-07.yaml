    visual: |
      A guardian made of wind and golden gears blocks the path through the Library's mechanical chamber.
      It's dynamic and beautiful—constantly shifting between lightning-fast movement and complete
      stillness. The guardian lunges at Micah with whip-quick gear-tendrils. Micah dodges left, rolls,
      comes up running. The guardian freezes completely still. Micah mirrors it, freezing too. Then it
      bursts forward again. Micah's expression shows intense focus and excitement—this is the most
      intense game of freeze tag ever. His body is in dynamic motion mid-dodge, showing his parkour
      skills. The atmosphere is high-energy action, fun and challenging, like a dance battle. Text in

      A guardian made of wind and golden gears blocked the next course. It moved in bursts—lightning fast, then completely still. It lunged at Micah. He dodged, rolled, came up running. It froze. He froze. It burst forward again. This was the most intense game of freeze tag he'd ever played.

    focus: Victory but challenge escalates
    visual: |
      Micah matches the guardian's rhythm perfectly—sprint, freeze, sprint, freeze—until he reaches
      its glowing center crystal. He touches it and the guardian dissolves into peaceful golden light.
      Micah is breathing hard but triumphant. He pushes forward to the physical mechanisms pedestal,
      which activates with spinning gears, levers, and platforms. The mechanism demands constant
      alternation: sprint here, freeze there, precise timing. Micah attempts it—he moves fast,
      pauses, moves again. But the sequence is incredibly complex. He's partway through when a gear
      shifts unexpectedly. He stumbles, catches himself. The mechanism resets with a discordant clang.
      His expression shifts from confidence to frustration. He's already tired from the guardian
      battle. The atmosphere shows the challenge intensifying beyond what he expected. Text in Times

      Micah matched the guardian's rhythm—sprint, freeze, sprint, freeze. He reached its center and touched the glowing crystal there. The guardian dissolved into light. Breathing hard but grinning, he pushed forward to the pedestal. The mechanisms activated—gears spinning, platforms shifting, demanding split-second timing. Sprint, freeze, sprint, freeze. He made it halfway before a gear shifted wrong. He stumbled. The whole thing reset with a harsh clang. "Come on!" he muttered. Already exhausted from the guardian. But the pedestal just waited, gleaming. Ready for him to try again.
