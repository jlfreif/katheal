      Micah sits cross-legged in a quiet clearing, hands resting on his knees in a meditation
      pose. His body trembles with the effort of staying still. His jaw is clenched with
      concentration. Around him, golden threads drift peacefully, responding to his forced
      calm. Several threads have untangled themselves and glow brightly. But his foot taps
      involuntarily. His fingers twitch. Staying still is clearly taking enormous effort.
      Sweat beads on his forehead despite the gentle forest breeze. Small creatures watch,
      encouraging.

      Micah sat still. It was the hardest thing he'd ever done. His whole body wanted to run,
      to jump, to move. But he breathed. In. Out. Slow. The threads around him relaxed,
      unwinding like tight muscles after a stretch. It was working! He just had to keep...
      staying... still. His foot tapped. No! Stop. Breathe. This took more courage than any climb.

    focus: Realizing something is missing

    visual: |
      Micah's forced stillness breaks as he jumps up in frustration, unable to maintain it
      any longer. He points toward the massive Heart Crystal visible through the trees, where
      the deepest, oldest tangles pulse with dark, agitated energy. These ancient knots remain
      untouched despite his progress. His expression shows frustration mixed with exhaustion.
      The threads he'd calmed begin to drift back toward chaos as his energy spikes again.
      The gap between his capability and the need is starkly visible. He's breathing hard again.

      But then his body betrayed him. He jumped up, unable to sit another second. "I can't
      do this!" The words burst out. Near the Heart Crystal, the biggest tangles still
      pulsed dark and tight. Those needed someone who could be still for longer than a few
      breaths. Someone who could stay calm when everything felt urgent. He looked at his
      shaking hands. Was he even capable of that kind of stillness?
