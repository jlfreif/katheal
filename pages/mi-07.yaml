    focus: Making real progress

    visual: |
      Micah moves through a series of slow, flowing parkour movements—stepping onto a stone,
      balancing on a beam, vaulting gently over a log—each motion perfectly timed to his
      breathing. Golden threads weave themselves together in his wake, creating a restored
      section of the magical network that glows steadily. His face shows focused determination
      and pride. This technique is working.

      Breathe in, step up. Breathe out, reach forward. Micah moved through his sequence,
      and the threads responded beautifully, weaving themselves together wherever his
      breath-paced movements led. Behind him, a whole section of the network glowed stable
      and bright. He grinned without breaking his rhythm. "Yes! It's working!" One breath,
      one movement, one thread at a time.

    focus: Realizing the overwhelming scale

    visual: |
      Micah pauses mid-movement and looks toward the horizon. The Heart Crystal rises in
      the distance, still fractured with countless cracks spreading outward like a shattered
      windshield. Thousands of threads hang loose and flickering across the entire forest,
      far more than his small restored section. His confident expression falters. His
      shoulders sag slightly as the enormity hits him.

      Micah paused to catch his breath and looked up. The Heart Crystal towered in the
      distance, cracks spreading across its surface like lightning. Thousands of threads—
      tens of thousands—hung loose across the whole forest. His restored section was just
      a tiny patch of light in an ocean of failing magic. "How can I..." His voice trailed
      off. The breath caught in his chest, but this time not from focus—from doubt. One
      person, one breath at a time, against all that?
