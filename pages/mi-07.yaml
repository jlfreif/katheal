      Micah moves through the still garden, but now with intentionality. Breathe in. Vault over
      a stone. Breathe out. Land softly. Breathe in. Climb a tree branch. Breathe out. Jump to
      the next platform. Each movement flows from breath, controlled and powerful. He's faster
      than before but also calmer. The golden creature watches, impressed. Other garden creatures
      pause to watch this new way of moving—kinetic energy channeled through stillness. His
      expression shows focused flow and growing confidence. The atmosphere celebrates the
      integration of opposites—movement and stillness working together.

      Micah moved through the garden differently now. Breathe in. Jump. Breathe out. Land. Breathe in. Climb. Breathe out. Move. Each motion flowed from breath. He was faster than before but calmer. Controlled. The golden creature watched, intrigued. He was getting it.

    focus: Realizing something is missing
    visual: |
      Excited by his progress, Micah abandons the breathing rhythm and tries to go full speed
      again—vaulting, jumping, flipping rapidly without pause. At first it seems to work, but
      then he loses control. He stumbles on a landing, crashes into a tree, falls hard. The power
      he'd felt disappears instantly. Back to chaos. The golden creature shakes its head. Micah
      sits there frustrated, realizing that understanding the technique isn't enough—he has to
      actually use it, especially when he wants to go fast. The hardest part is remembering to
      breathe when everything in him screams to just GO. His expression shows disappointed
      realization. The atmosphere shows the gap between knowing and doing.

      Then Micah got excited and went faster. Forgot to breathe. Just moved-moved-moved like before. He stumbled, crashed into a branch, fell. All the power drained away. The golden creature waited patiently above. Knowing how to breathe wasn't enough. He had to actually do it—especially when he wanted to go fast. That was the hard part.
