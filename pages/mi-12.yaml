      Micah walks through the Library of Lost Patterns toward home. Golden wristband glows on his wrist.
      Around him, mechanisms move in perfect rhythms now—bright and dim, fast and slow, all working
      together. Gears turn smoothly. Pulleys lift. Levers balance. The silver fox sits on a floating
      scroll, tail swishing in approval. The courses are alive with possibility, challenges waiting for
      anyone brave enough to try. Micah's expression shows satisfaction and readiness—he conquered
      something genuinely difficult. The atmosphere celebrates victory and the promise of future
      adventures. His bedroom window appears ahead through golden threads. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      Micah walked home through the Library. Mechanisms moved in perfect rhythms now—bright and dim, fast and slow, all working together. The silver fox sat on a scroll, tail swishing. "Thanks for the workout," Micah called. The fox's eyes gleamed. His bedroom window appeared ahead, exactly where he'd left it. The wristband hummed softly on his wrist.

      Micah in his room, moving through his parkour course with enhanced ability. He vaults over the
      chair in full athletic motion—then pauses mid-air, perfectly still for a heartbeat, before
      continuing. The combination makes him even faster and more capable than before. The wristband
      glows. He grins, speaking in Japanese—his energy is still there but now he has an additional
      tool. His expression shows confident joy—not reformed, but expanded. At the window, golden light
      flickers. The fox tilts its head from a tree outside. Micah waves, ready for the next challenge.
      Mechanisms gleam faintly in the air around him. The atmosphere celebrates growth through mastering
      difficult challenges. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Micah landed in his room, the wristband warm against his skin. He vaulted over the chair—then paused on the landing, perfectly still, feeling the moment. Then moved again. Fast and still. Movement and pause. Both were power. Not because he'd been doing it wrong before. Because now he knew there was even more he could do. He grinned and spoke in Japanese: "Ready for round two." At the window, golden light flickered. The fox tilted its head. Micah waved.
