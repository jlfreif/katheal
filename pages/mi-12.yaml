      Micah's room, the same obstacle course setup as the opening. His furniture still arranged
      for parkour—chair backs, bed frame, desk. But now everything feels different. Micah stands
      in the center, still for a moment, breathing. The golden creature's feather rests on his
      desk, glowing softly. Outside his window, trees sway in breeze. His trombone waits in the
      corner. The room hasn't changed, but he has. His expression shows peaceful readiness rather
      than restless energy. The atmosphere is familiar but transformed by integrated stillness.

      The golden threads led them all back. Through the tower. Through his window. Micah stood in his room—his parkour course still there. But he didn't feel the need to jump immediately. He breathed. The golden creature's feather glowed on his desk. He smiled, centered and calm.

      Micah moves through his parkour course, but completely differently than the opening. Breathe
      in—vault over the chair with perfect form. Breathe out—land soft and controlled. Breathe
      in—climb the bookshelf with fluid grace. Breathe out—flip to the bed. Each movement is
      faster and more impressive than before, but flowing from stillness rather than fighting it.
      The feather in his pocket glows. Golden threads shimmer through his movements, showing the
      integration of breath and motion. His expression shows joyful flow state—moving and being
      still at the same time. The scene celebrates the power of centered action.

      Micah moved through his room. Breathe in. Jump. Breathe out. Land. Breathe in. Climb. He was faster than before. Stronger. But also calm. Centered. The golden feather glowed. Golden threads shimmered through each motion. "This is my courage," he whispered, flowing from stillness. "Moving and being still. Breathing through everything."
