      Micah's backyard looks the same: wooden obstacles, balance beams, rope swing, trombone
      case on the porch. Micah stands at the starting position for his parkour run, same as
      the opening. But his posture is different—centered, grounded, one hand resting briefly
      on the golden compass around his neck. He takes a visible breath before beginning. The
      afternoon light is warm and golden.

      Micah's backyard looked the same: wooden rails, balance beams, his trombone waiting
      on the porch. "Faster," he'd told himself before. Now he stood at the start of his
      run and smiled at the memory. The compass around his neck pulsed gently, warm against
      his chest. He touched it once, then took a deep breath. Not to stop moving. To move
      better.

    visual: |
      Micah flows through his parkour sequence in a beautiful rhythm—vault over the rail
      perfectly timed to his exhale, land and roll on the inhale, rise again with breath.
      His movement is just as athletic but more controlled, more graceful. The golden compass
      glows softly at his chest. At the edge of the yard, a golden thread shimmers in the
      air, and the moth from Kathaél watches with approval. His expression shows pure joy.

      Breathe in, run. Breathe out, vault. Micah moved through his sequence, and it felt
      like flying. The same obstacles, the same movements, but now they flowed together—
      motion and breath as one rhythm. When chaos came, he'd know what to do. Pause. Breathe.
      See clearly. Then move with purpose. The compass pulsed in time with his heartbeat.
      Courage wasn't constant motion. It was knowing when to pause, when to breathe, when
      to jump. And right now, it was time to jump.
