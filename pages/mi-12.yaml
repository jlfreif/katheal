    visual: |
      Micah stands in the same park where his journey began, in almost the exact spot where
      he knelt to tie his shoe. Everything looks familiar: the benches, the trees, the other
      kids playing. But his posture is different. He stands still for a moment, just breathing,
      watching the world around him. The golden thread bracelet glows softly on his wrist.
      Other kids run past but he doesn't immediately chase them. His expression shows someone
      who's learned something important. The scene mirrors the opening but his energy is changed.

      Micah was back in the park. Same trees. Same benches. Same restless energy inside him
      wanting to run and climb and move. But now he paused. Just for a moment. Breathed.
      The golden thread on his wrist pulsed with his breath, warm and steady. The world
      didn't feel so urgent anymore. There was time to be still. And time to move.

    focus: Transformed by the journey

    visual: |
      Micah runs through the park with other kids, vaulting over the same bench from the
      opening scene. But now when he lands, he pauses mid-run to take a breath, grinning.
      The golden thread glows brighter as he breathes. Around him, subtle magic appears:
      the air seems clearer, his movements more graceful and intentional rather than frantic.
      He's still in motion, still energetic, but there's rhythm to it now. He's discovered
      balance. His expression shows joy mixed with peace. He can be both: active AND still.

      Then he ran. Because he still loved running. Still loved climbing and jumping and
      moving through the world at top speed. But now, when his lungs burned or his thoughts
      raced too fast, he knew what to do. He could stop. Breathe. Find his center. Then
      move again. The golden thread pulsed on his wrist. Being still wasn't the opposite
      of being active. It was the thing that made being active even better. Micah grinned
      and took a deep breath. He had so much energy for what came next.
