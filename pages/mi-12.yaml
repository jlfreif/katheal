      Micah's room, the same obstacle course setup as the opening. Micah stands in the center,
      the wind chime from Kathaél hanging on his bedpost, glowing softly. He looks at his parkour
      course with new understanding—the same furniture, but he approaches it differently now.
      His expression shows peaceful energy. The atmosphere is familiar but transformed by wisdom
      gained.

      Micah stood in his room, same obstacle course as before. But he wasn't the same. The wind chime hung on his bedpost, glowing gentle reminder. He took a breath, feeling center settle. Then he was ready to move.

      Micah moves through his parkour course with breathtaking grace and power—vaulting over the
      chair (preceded by centered breath), landing on the pillow (with controlled pause), climbing
      the bedpost (from gathered stillness). Each movement is more powerful than his frantic
      earlier attempts because it comes from centered pause. The wind chime rings with his breathing.
      Golden threads appear faintly in his ordinary room, Kathaél's magic woven through every
      intentional breath. His expression shows joyful powerful energy. The scene feels triumphant—
      magic lived through balance of motion and stillness.

      Micah breathed, then vaulted. Paused, then climbed. Centered, then leaped. The wind chime rang in rhythm. Golden threads appeared. Pause wasn't weakness. It was power gathering itself to act.
