      Micah's room, the same setup as the opening. His bookshelf still there, furniture still
      climbable. But now the window is open and outside, real trees rise tall, their branches
      reaching high into the sky. A golden feather from the eagle rests on his desk, glowing
      softly. Micah stands looking at the trees with new eyes—not scary anymore, but inviting.
      His expression shows peaceful confidence. The atmosphere is familiar but transformed by
      conquered fear.

      The golden threads led them all back. Through the tower. Through his window. Micah stood in his room, looking out at the tall trees outside. He'd never climbed them before—too high, too scary. The eagle's feather glowed on his desk. He smiled.

      Micah climbs out his window onto the nearest tree, moving with confidence up through the
      branches. Eyes forward, finding the next hold, going higher than he ever dared before. He
      reaches a branch fifteen feet up and sits there, looking out over the neighborhood. The
      feather in his pocket glows. Golden threads shimmer faintly around him, Kathaél's magic
      woven through his courage. His expression shows joyful fearlessness. The scene celebrates
      courage that opens new heights.

      Micah climbed out his window into the tree. Up through branches, higher and higher. Eyes forward, not down. The eagle's feather glowed in his pocket. Golden threads shimmered. Heights weren't scary anymore. They were freedom. "This is my courage," he whispered from the branches. "Climbing even when I'm afraid. Reaching higher."
