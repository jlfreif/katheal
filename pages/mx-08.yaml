      A workshop inside a hollow tree, littered with Max's failed experimental attempts. Broken
      contraptions everywhere—devices that sparked then died, mechanisms that moved wrong, inventions
      that almost worked but didn't. Max sits slumped on the floor, back against the wall, tools
      scattered around him. His usually energetic posture is collapsed. His notebook lies open
      showing pages of crossed-out ideas. The clockwork deer sits nearby, still frozen. Everything
      he's tried has failed. His expression shows deep exhaustion and self-doubt. The workshop
      feels oppressive with accumulated failure.

      Max stared at the pile of failures surrounding him. Every playful experiment, every curious
      try, every courageous attempt—all broken. His analytical approach hadn't worked. Playful
      exploration hadn't worked. Nothing worked. The deer stayed frozen, and he was out of ideas.
      Maybe he wasn't good enough for Kathaél's magic. Maybe some problems were meant to stay
      unsolved.

      Max still slumped, but his eyes focus on one particular failed experiment—a tiny clockwork
      mouse that moves in circles. It's broken, yes, but it moves. It tried. Around the workshop,
      he notices other "failures" that actually taught him something: the gear that sparked showed
      him energy patterns, the spring that snapped revealed tension points, the bird that flew
      crooked still flew. His expression begins to shift from defeat to dawning realization. The
      clockwork deer's thread glows faintly, as if sensing his shift. The atmosphere lightens
      slightly, hope creeping back in.

      A broken clockwork mouse whirred nearby, spinning in circles. Failed, yes. But moving. Trying.
      Max looked at his failures with new eyes. Each one had taught him something. The experiments
      that didn't work showed him what did. That was science. That was invention. Not getting it
      right immediately, but learning from every attempt. He'd been so focused on final success,
      he'd missed the value of the process. Maybe trying mattered more than succeeding.
