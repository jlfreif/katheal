      The central challenge course rises before Max - massive, complex, impossible-looking. Ten
      obstacles woven together, each requiring perfect timing. Max is in mid-attempt, clearly
      several tries in. His legs shake from exhaustion. His hands show scrapes from multiple
      attempts. Behind him we can see evidence of failed attempts - disturbed ground, reset
      obstacles. The course itself is indifferent, humming with complexity. The atmosphere shows
      genuine difficulty. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The central course rose before them: massive, complex, impossible. Ten obstacles woven together, each requiring perfect timing. Max tried. He made it through three obstacles before the fourth shifted and he fell. He tried again. Fell at obstacle six. Again. Again. His legs shook. His hands were raw. The course hummed, indifferent to his effort.

    focus: Natural frustration at genuine difficulty
    visual: |
      Max sits on the ground, breathing hard, genuinely exhausted. Maya sits beside him offering
      water. Max's expression shows natural frustration - not at himself, but at the sheer
      difficulty of the challenge. "This is ridiculous. It's just too hard." The fox watches
      patiently nearby. But Max's eyes are starting to see something - the way the obstacles move,
      there's a pattern. Not random. They're showing him something. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      Max sat on the ground, breathing hard. Maya offered water. "This is ridiculous," he muttered. "I've tried everything. It's just too hard." Maya sat beside him. "Maybe it's supposed to be." Max looked up. The fox was there again, patient. Watching. Max wiped sweat from his face and stared at the course. Wait. There. The way the obstacles moved. They weren't random. They were showing him something.
