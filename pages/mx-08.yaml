      Max stands in a training ground littered with broken obstacles, twisted
      metal, collapsed structures—all his earlier "perfect" attempts that
      failed catastrophically. Rain begins to fall. The Heart Crystal in
      the distance cracks with an audible sound. A challenge course nearby
      crumbles to dust. His tall athletic frame looks small against the damage.

      The training ground stretched before him, destroyed. Every challenge he'd tried to complete perfectly lay in ruins. Twisted metal, broken beams, courses that would never work again. Rain started falling, cold and heavy. The Crystal cracked louder. A nearby course collapsed to dust. "I thought I could fix this," Max whispered. "I just made everything worse."

      Max sits slumped against a fallen obstacle, rain soaking his red hair,
      notebook abandoned beside him with pages smeared. His arms rest on his
      knees, head down. A small bird lands on the wreckage nearby, not singing,
      just present. One weak golden thread still glows faintly in the debris.

      Max sank down against the wreckage, rain streaming down his face. His notebook lay beside him, all his systems smeared into illegible ink. He'd tried so hard. Analyzed everything. But these big mistakes? The bird above didn't move. Just stayed. Max noticed the thread still glowing weakly in the debris. Even ruined, it hadn't completely died.
