      Max stands in a training ground littered with broken obstacles, twisted
      metal, collapsed structures—all his earlier "perfect" attempts that
      failed catastrophically. Rain begins to fall. The Heart Crystal in
      the distance cracks with an audible sound. A challenge course nearby
      crumbles to dust. His tall athletic frame looks small against the damage.

      The training ground stretched before him, destroyed. Every challenge he'd attempted lay in ruins. His first try—twisted metal. His second try—broken beams. His tenth try—collapsed to dust. So many mistakes. So much wreckage. Each one a failure. Each one making things worse instead of better. Rain started falling, cold and heavy. The Heart Crystal cracked louder in the distance. "I thought mistakes were supposed to teach you," Max whispered. "But what if some mistakes are just... too big?"

    visual: |
      Max sits slumped against a fallen obstacle, rain soaking his red hair,
      notebook abandoned beside him with pages smeared. His arms rest on his
      knees, head down. A small bird lands on the wreckage nearby, not singing,
      just present. One weak golden thread still glows faintly in the debris.

      Max sank down against the wreckage, rain streaming down his face. His notebook lay beside him, filled with crossed-out attempts. Each mistake documented. Each failure analyzed. So much effort. So many tries. And still—this. "Maybe some mistakes break things forever," he thought. The bird above didn't move. Just stayed, perched on the ruins of his tenth attempt. Max's eyes caught the golden thread still glowing weakly in the wreckage of his very first try. Even destroyed, even wrong, it hadn't completely died. His mistakes were still here. Still teaching him something. But what?
