    focus: External obstacles intensify
    visual: |
      The central course connected to the pedestal rises before Max—massive, complex, impossible-looking.
      Ten obstacles woven together in the Library air, each requiring perfect timing and adaptation. Max
      is mid-attempt, clearly several tries in. His legs shake from physical exhaustion. Sweat drips.
      Behind him we can see evidence of failed attempts—reset obstacles, dark threads. The course itself
      is indifferent, shifting and adapting with mechanical precision. Through the Library windows, the
      Heart Crystal pulses frantically. This isn't him failing—this is the course pushing his limits
      at bottom.

      The central course rose before him: massive, complex, impossible. Ten obstacles woven together, each requiring perfect timing. Max tried. He made it through three obstacles before the fourth shifted and he fell. He tried again. Fell at obstacle six. Again. Again. His legs shook. His hands were raw. The course hummed, indifferent to his effort.

    focus: Natural frustration at genuine difficulty
    visual: |
      Max sits on the Library floor woven with golden light, breathing hard, genuinely exhausted. His
      expression shows natural frustration—not at himself, but at the sheer difficulty of the challenge.
      "This is ridiculous. It's just too hard." The fox watches patiently nearby from among floating
      books, sitting at the edge of the course. But Max's eyes are starting to see something—the way the
      obstacles move. They aren't random. There's a pattern to how they shift. A rhythm to the adaptation

      Max sat on the ground, breathing hard. "This is ridiculous," he muttered. "I've tried everything. It's just too hard." But even as he said it, something caught his attention. The fox was there again, patient. Watching. Max wiped sweat from his face and stared at the course. Wait. There. The way the obstacles moved. They weren't random. They were showing him something.
