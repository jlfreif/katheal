    focus: External obstacles intensify
    visual: |
      The central sequence chamber in the Library rises before Max—massive, complex, impossible-looking.
      Ten interconnected number patterns woven together, each requiring perfect adaptation. Max is in
      mid-attempt, clearly several tries in. His shoulders sag from mental exhaustion. His notes show
      dozens of crossed-out attempts. Behind him we can see evidence of failed attempts—sequences that
      reset, patterns that dissolved. The sequences themselves are indifferent, shifting and branching
      with mathematical precision. Through the windows, the Heart Crystal pulses frantically. This
      isn't him failing—this is the Library pushing his limits deliberately. The atmosphere shows genuine
      difficulty. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The central sequence rose before him: massive, complex, impossible. Ten patterns woven together, each requiring perfect adaptation. Max tried. He made it through three sequences before the fourth branched in unexpected ways. He tried again. Failed at sequence six. Again. Again. His head ached. His notes were full. The sequences hummed, indifferent to his effort.

    focus: Natural frustration at genuine difficulty
    visual: |
      Max sits on the Library floor, breathing hard, genuinely exhausted. His expression shows natural
      frustration—not at himself, but at the sheer difficulty of the challenge. "This is ridiculous.
      It's just too hard." The fox watches patiently nearby. But Max's eyes are starting to see something—
      the way the sequences move, there's a pattern to their changes. Not random. They're showing him
      something. A rhythm to the adaptation itself. His analytical mind catches something he almost
      missed. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max sat on the floor, breathing hard. "This is ridiculous," he muttered. "I've tried everything. It's just too hard." The fox was there again, patient. Watching. Max wiped his forehead and stared at the sequences. Wait. There. The way they changed. They weren't random. There was a pattern to the adaptation itself. A rhythm.
