    focus: External obstacles intensify
    visual: |
      The central course rises before Max—massive, complex, impossible-looking. Ten obstacles woven
      together, each requiring perfect timing and adaptation. Max is mid-attempt, clearly several tries
      in. His legs shake from physical exhaustion. Sweat drips. Behind him we can see evidence of failed
      attempts—reset obstacles, dark threads. The course itself is indifferent, shifting and adapting
      with mechanical precision. In the distance, the Heart Crystal pulses frantically. This isn't him
      failing—this is the course pushing his limits deliberately. The atmosphere shows genuine difficulty.

      The central course rose before them: massive, complex, impossible. Ten obstacles woven together, each requiring perfect timing. Max tried. He made it through three obstacles before the fourth shifted and he fell. He tried again. Fell at obstacle six. Again. Again. His legs shook. His hands were raw. The course hummed, indifferent to his effort.

    focus: Natural frustration at genuine difficulty
    visual: |
      Max sits on the ground, breathing hard, genuinely exhausted. Maya offers water. His expression
      shows natural frustration—not at himself, but at the sheer difficulty of the challenge. "This is
      ridiculous. It's just too hard." The fox watches patiently nearby. But Max's eyes are starting to
      see something—the way the obstacles move. They aren't random. There's a pattern to how they shift.
      A rhythm to the adaptation itself. His athletic instincts catch something he almost missed. Text

      Max sat on the ground, breathing hard. Maya offered water. "This is ridiculous," he muttered. "I've tried everything. It's just too hard." Maya sat beside him. "Maybe it's supposed to be." Max looked up. The fox was there again, patient. Watching. Max wiped sweat from his face and stared at the course. Wait. There. The way the obstacles moved. They weren't random. They were showing him something.
