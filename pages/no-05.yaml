id: no-05
spread: 5
beat: "Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)"

hook: Questionable character offers confident solution, creating doubt about whether to trust them.
payoff: The suggested solution fails spectacularly and obviously wrong.

description: Noah ventures deeper into Kathaél and meets a flashy storyteller who promises an easy fix, but the advice leads him astray.

visual: |
  Noah stands in a clearing where the forest opens up to reveal a much wider view of
  Kathaél—rolling hills of luminescent meadows, distant mountains with peaks that
  shimmer, and the sky showing both twilight stars and hints of dawn simultaneously.
  In the center of the clearing stands a flamboyant figure: a tall, theatrical
  storyteller wearing a patched coat covered in ribbons and trinkets, gesturing
  dramatically with both arms spread wide. The storyteller has an oversized smile
  and is mid-speech, clearly promising something grand. Noah stands facing them,
  his notebook clutched to his chest, his expression showing both hope and uncertainty—
  he wants to believe but something feels off. Between them on the ground is an
  elaborate diagram the storyteller has drawn in the dirt with a stick: a complex
  pattern of circles and lines that looks impressive but makes no practical sense.
  Around the clearing's perimeter, various golden threads from the Heart-Loom hang
  visibly in the air, some frayed, some glowing strong. Small forest creatures peek
  from behind trees and bushes, watching the scene with what appears to be skepticism.
  The light in the clearing has a slightly garish quality, as if the storyteller's
  presence makes everything a bit too bright, too showy.

  The storyteller promised Noah that grand gestures and dramatic words could fix anything. Noah wanted to believe, even though something felt wrong.
