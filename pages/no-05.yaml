      Noah stands at the edge of a clearing where Kathaél opens wide: rolling
      luminescent meadows stretch toward shimmering mountains. The sky shows both
      twilight stars and hints of dawn. Golden threads hang at different heights,
      some frayed, some glowing. His expression mixes wonder with uncertainty as
      he surveys this vast, unfamiliar landscape.

      Noah climbed a ridge and stopped, breathless. Kathaél stretched farther than
      he could have imagined: meadows that glowed softly, mountains that shimmered
      like heat mirages, and a sky that couldn't decide between night and day.
      Golden threads crisscrossed everywhere, some broken, some bright. The problem
      was so much bigger than he'd realized.

    visual: |
      A tall, theatrical figure in a patched coat covered with ribbons gestures
      dramatically toward Noah, arms spread wide, oversized smile beaming. An
      elaborate diagram of circles and lines covers the ground between them. Noah
      clutches his notebook to his chest, leaning back slightly. Small creatures
      watch from behind trees with skeptical expressions.

      "Grand gestures!" The storyteller's coat jangled with trinkets as he swept
      his arms wide. "Dramatic words! That's how you fix broken stories!" He
      pointed at an elaborate diagram scratched in the dirt. Noah wanted to believe
      him. The plan looked impressive, like it came from someone who knew secrets.
      But the watching animals had retreated, and that felt like a warning.
