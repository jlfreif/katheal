      Noah stands at the edge of a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads
      hang suspended, all frayed and flickering. Words shimmer in the air like dying
      fireflies. The Heart-Loom pulses weakly in the distance, visibly dimmer than
      before. His expression shows alarm at the scale of the crisis.

      The clearing stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen stories hung in
      the air, all fraying at the edges. "He opened the letter and..." "The door
      swung wide to reveal..." "She finally understood that..." Noah's chest
      tightened. The Heart-Loom pulsed dimmer in the distance. "This is way
      bigger than I thought." He hoped the girl at the crossroads was having
      better luck.

    visual: |
      A theatrical figure in a patched coat covered with story-fragments gestures
      wildly. Behind him, a story-thread writhes and knots tighter, rejecting his
      forced ending. Noah steps back, alarm on his face. The thread's glow dims
      dangerously.

      "You want to help stories? I know exactly what they need!" The storyteller's
      coat jangled with dangling plot threads. "Twist endings! Shocking surprises!"
      He grabbed a thread and forced words onto it: "And it was all a dream!" The
      thread shuddered, knotted tighter, and dimmed. "Wait, stop!" Noah reached
      out. "You're making it worse!" But the storyteller was already grabbing
      another.
