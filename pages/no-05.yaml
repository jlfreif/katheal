description: Noah meets Bramblebeard, the grumpy moss giant who guards the Grove of Echoing Paths, and receives a warning that time is running short—the woods will close their secrets at sunset.

visual: |
  Noah breaks into a run toward the Singing Stones visible in the distance—a circle of
  tall iridescent pillars humming with barely audible music. His compass glows brighter,
  pointing urgently forward. The sun sits lower on the horizon now, painting everything
  in amber and shadow. Noah's expression shows determination mixed with rising panic.
  Leaves swirl behind him. Time is running out.

  Bramblebeard the moss giant loomed before Noah, blocking the path. "You carry the
  Seeker's tool," the giant grunted. "But beware—the Singing Stones ahead test more than
  navigation. They test whether you can hear truth beneath the noise." Then came the warning:
  "The woods shift at twilight. If you haven't found your answer by sunset, the paths will
  close." Noah's heartbeat quickened. He ran, compass pulsing faster, matching his heartbeat.
  He had to reach the Singing Stones before dark—before the woods closed their secrets away.
