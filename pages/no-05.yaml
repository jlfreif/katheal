      Noah stands at the edge of a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads
      hang suspended, all ending mid-sentence. Words shimmer in the air like frozen
      fireflies: fragments of stories waiting. The sky shows twilight stars and hints
      of dawn. His expression mixes awe with overwhelm at the scale of unfinished tales.

      The clearing stretched impossibly wide, filled with hundreds of frozen stories.
      Words hung in the air everywhere Noah looked: "He opened the letter and—"
      "The door swung wide to reveal—" "She finally understood that—" All waiting.
      All stuck. The problem was so much bigger than one boy with a notebook.

    visual: |
      A theatrical figure in a patched coat covered with story-fragments gestures
      wildly, demonstrating a shocking twist ending with dramatic arm movements.
      Behind him, a story-thread writhes and tangles, rejecting his forced conclusion.
      Noah watches uncertainly, notebook clutched to his chest. Forest creatures
      have retreated to the shadows.

      "Twist endings!" The storyteller's coat jangled with dangling plot threads.
      "Every story needs a shocking surprise! Watch!" He grabbed a frozen thread and
      forced an ending onto it: "—and it was all a dream!" The thread shuddered and
      knotted tighter. Noah's stomach sank. That wasn't right either.
