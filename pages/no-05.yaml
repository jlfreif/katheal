      Noah stands at the edge of a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads
      hang suspended, all frayed and flickering. Words shimmer in the air like dying
      fireflies. The Crystal pulsed dimly in the distance, and Noah gasped as a nearby
      flower's petals turned to dust. A bird mid-song forgot its melody and went silent.
      His expression shows alarm at the scale of the crisis.

      The clearing stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen stories hung in
      the air, all fraying at the edges. "He opened the letter and..." "The door
      swung wide to reveal..." "She finally understood that..." The Crystal pulsed
      dimmer in the distance, and Noah gasped as a nearby flower's petals turned to
      dust. A bird mid-song forgot its melody and went silent. "Oh no. This is really bad."
      He hoped the girl at the crossroads was having better luck.

    visual: |
      A figure in a patched coat covered with diagrams and charts gestures
      systematically at a flowchart in the air. Behind him, a story-thread writhes
      and knots tighter, rejecting his formulaic ending. Noah steps back, alarm
      on his face as he recognizes his own approach. The thread's glow dims dangerously.

      "You want to help stories? I have the formula!" The storyteller's coat jangled
      with dangling plot threads. "Every story follows rules. Hero's journey—
      twelve steps, perfectly predictable!" The storyteller lunged forward, grabbing
      threads with both hands. "Surprise endings!" he bellowed. Words exploded from his
      fingers: "It was all a DREAM!" The thread writhed like a snake, knotted itself into
      a tight ball, and started smoking. "Stop!" Noah shouted, running forward. "You're
      hurting it!" The storyteller spun toward another thread. Noah dove, trying to reach
      it first. Too late—another knot, another dimming light. The Crystal in the distance
      flickered and cracked further.
