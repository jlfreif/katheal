      Noah walks back to the Grove of Truth as twilight deepens. He moves differently now—steadier,
      more purposeful. His hand rests on the feather charm in his pocket. The compass glows warmly,
      but Noah isn't staring at it constantly anymore. He's learned to feel his way forward. The
      grove appears ahead, ancient oaks illuminated by the last golden light. Fireflies begin their
      evening dance.

      Noah returned to the pool, but everything had changed—not the grove, but him. He wasn't
      seeking certainty anymore. He was seeking courage to choose anyway.

      Noah kneels at the crystalline pool again, but this time he doesn't flinch from the shadows
      of his fears swirling in the reflection. Instead, he leans closer, studying them. His
      expression shows recognition: these aren't enemies—they're part of the path. Every doubt,
      every wrong turn, every moment of uncertainty led him here. The feather charm glows faintly
      in his pocket. The compass rests beside him, patient.

      This time, Noah looked his fears in the eye. "You're not wrong choices," he whispered to
      his reflection. "You're how I learned what mattered." The shadows in the water stilled,
      listening.
