      Elise sits in her window seat again—the same sunny spot, the same art supplies scattered
      around. But everything feels different. She's working in her new starlight journal, writing
      observations in her own clear handwriting: "I notice..." "I see..." "I understand..." Her
      restored paperbird perches on the windowsill, wings glowing gently as she writes. The walls
      still display her nature sketches, but now there are words added beneath them—her voice
      giving meaning to what she's observed. She's singing softly to herself as she works.

      Elise wrote in her starlight journal, her voice flowing onto paper easily now: "I notice the
      way light catches spider webs. I see courage in small creatures. I understand that quiet
      observation is a gift." Her paperbird glowed with approval.

      Elise stands at her window as evening approaches, holding her sketchbook open to show a
      friend who's visiting—she's speaking up now, sharing her art and observations without fear.
      Her paperbird flies lazy circles around the room. On her desk, the starlight journal lies
      open to a new entry titled: "The Voice of the Paperbird: How I Learned That Gentle Voices
      Matter." She's begun writing her story, ready to share it. Outside the window, the Whispering
      Woods shimmer in the distance, and new paperbirds flutter past—maybe waiting for the next
      quiet child who needs to find their voice.

      Elise shared her art, spoke her observations, wrote her truths. Her voice was still gentle,
      still quiet—but now she knew that didn't make it less powerful. The paperbird sang in
      agreement, and Elise smiled. This was just the beginning.
