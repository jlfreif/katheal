      Elise dances slowly through a meadow, moving from flower to flower with graceful,
      flowing gestures. As her hands pass over each bloom, it glows with restored color.
      Around her path, a trail of healed flowers creates an island of beauty. A lantern
      hangs from a crooked post nearby, its flame burning steady. Her expression shows
      peaceful focus. This is working.

      Flower by flower, Elise danced them back to life. She moved through the meadow
      with gentle turns and flowing gestures, and where her dance touched, blooms
      remembered their beauty. The lantern nearby burned steady, its flame matching
      her calm focus. She'd found the answer. This was working.

    focus: Realizing something is missing

    visual: |
      Elise stops mid-dance and looks up from her small trail of restored flowers.
      The meadow stretches endlessly in every direction, thousands of grey flowers
      fading into the horizon. The lantern flame wavers as doubt creeps in. Her
      arms lower to her sides. One dance, one flower at a time, against all of this.

      Then Elise stopped and looked up. The meadow stretched forever. Thousands of
      grey flowers, tens of thousands, more than she could ever reach. The lantern
      flame wavered as her heart sank. Her gentle dance worked, but it was so slow.
      How could one quiet movement, one flower at a time, matter against all this grey?
