      A wide clearing in the Library where the path leads toward a chamber glowing with musical
      notes. But blocking the path stands a RHYTHM GUARDIAN—a massive creature made of crystallized
      sound waves and floating musical staffs, standing twice as tall as Elise. Its body pulses with
      beats, notes glowing across its surface. It has no face, just a chest that booms like a drum.
      The guardian stomps toward Elise, each step shaking the ground with deep bass thuds. Elise
      drops into a ready stance, feet apart, arms up. She's breathing hard from her journey but her
      expression shows determination mixed with excitement. The guardian stomps a rhythm—BOOM BOOM
      TAP. Challenging her. The clearing crackles with rhythm-battle energy. Books flutter excitedly
      on nearby branches. This will be a dance fight. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space

      The path led to the musical notes chamber. Almost there. Then the ground shook. A massive creature rose from crystallized sound—a Rhythm Guardian, twice her height, made of beats and notes. It stomped toward her. BOOM BOOM TAP. The ground trembled. Elise grinned despite her nerves. "Okay. Let's dance." She hit a sharp pop-and-lock. The battle began.

      Elise in mid-battle with the Rhythm Guardian. The guardian throws sonic pulses at her—waves
      of visible sound. Elise dodges with a spin, counters with a rapid-fire sequence of steps,
      strikes with a powerful body roll that sends golden light rippling through the guardian's form.
      The guardian cracks. She adds joy—a laugh, a silly wiggle, then a fierce hip-hop combination.
      The guardian shatters into notes of light that dissolve into the air, absorbed by the Library.
      Elise lands in a final pose, arms raised in victory. But then she drops to her hands and knees,
      breathing hard, sweat dripping, muscles trembling. She's completely exhausted. Her clothes are
      dusty, her ponytail messy. But she won. The path to the musical notes chamber lies open. She
      grins through her exhaustion. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The guardian threw sonic pulses. Visible waves of sound. Elise spun, dodged, struck back with a body roll that cracked its form. It reformed. Attacked again. She countered—rapid steps, then added joy—a laugh, a wiggle, a fierce combination. The guardian shattered into light. Victory. Elise dropped to her knees, breathing hard. Muscles shaking. Completely exhausted. "Did I just defeat a magical sound monster with a body roll?" She grinned. The path to the chamber waited. But first, she needed to catch her breath.
