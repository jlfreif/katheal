      Elise kneels in a meadow, hands cupped around a flower that glows with
      restored color. Around her, a small circle of healed blooms creates an
      island of beauty. A lantern hangs from a crooked post nearby, its flame
      burning steady. Her expression shows peaceful focus. This is working.

      Flower by flower, Elise brought color back. She cupped each bloom with
      patient attention, and one by one they remembered their beauty. The
      lantern nearby burned steady, its flame matching her calm focus. She'd
      found the answer. This was working.

    visual: |
      Elise stands and looks up from her small circle of restored flowers.
      The meadow stretches endlessly in every direction, thousands of grey
      flowers fading into the horizon. The lantern flame wavers as doubt
      creeps in. Her shoulders sag slightly. One flower at a time against
      all of this.

      Then Elise stood and looked up. The meadow stretched forever. Thousands
      of grey flowers, tens of thousands, more than she could ever reach. The
      lantern flame wavered as her heart sank. Her way worked, but it was so
      slow. How could attention to one flower matter against all this grey?
