      A wide clearing where the rhythm-path leads toward the Heart Crystal visible in the distance.
      But blocking the path stands a RHYTHM GOLEM—a massive creature made of broken rhythm-path
      pieces, standing twice as tall as Elise. Its body pulses with corrupted beats, footprints
      glowing darkly across its surface. It has no face, just a chest that booms like a drum.
      The golem stomps toward Elise, each step shaking the ground with deep bass thuds. Elise
      drops into a ready stance, feet apart, arms up. She's breathing hard from her journey but
      her expression shows determination mixed with excitement. The golem stomps a rhythm—BOOM
      BOOM TAP. Challenging her. The clearing crackles with rhythm-battle energy. This will be a
      dance fight.

      The path led to the Heart Crystal. Almost there. Then the ground shook. A massive creature rose from the broken paths—a Rhythm Golem, twice her height, made of corrupted beats. It stomped toward her. BOOM BOOM TAP. The ground trembled. Elise grinned despite her nerves. "Okay. Let's dance." She hit a sharp pop-and-lock. The battle began.

      Elise in mid-battle with the Rhythm Golem. The golem throws corrupted beats at her—dark
      pulses of energy. Elise dodges with a spin, counters with a rapid-fire sequence of steps,
      strikes with a powerful body roll that sends golden light rippling through the golem's form.
      The golem cracks. She adds joy—a laugh, a silly wiggle, then a fierce hip-hop combination.
      The golem shatters into pieces of light that dissolve into the air. Elise lands in a final
      pose, arms raised in victory. But then she drops to her hands and knees, breathing hard,
      sweat dripping, muscles trembling. She's completely exhausted. Her clothes are dusty, her
      ponytail messy. But she won. The path to the Heart Crystal lies open. She grins through her
      exhaustion.

      The golem threw corrupted beats. Dark pulses. Elise spun, dodged, struck back with a body roll that cracked its form. It reformed. Attacked again. She countered—rapid steps, then added joy—a laugh, a wiggle, a fierce combination. The golem shattered into light. Victory. Elise dropped to her knees, breathing hard. Muscles shaking. Completely exhausted. "Did I just defeat a magical creature with a body roll?" She grinned. The path to the Heart Crystal waited. But first, she needed to catch her breath.
