description: After parting with Noah at the Singing Stones, Elise follows the paperbird to the Garden of Whispers where she must speak her observations aloud, but her words come out too quiet, too uncertain—something is still missing.

visual: |
  Elise looks into the pool and sees not just her reflection but also images of all the things
  she's observed but never spoken aloud: beauty she noticed but didn't name, kindness she saw
  but didn't acknowledge, fears she felt but never shared, truths she understood but kept quiet.
  The paperbird hovers above the pool, and Elise realizes—it's fading because its story needs
  to be voiced, and she's the one who can truly see what that story is. Her hands hover over
  the water, trembling. She opens her mouth to speak, but fear catches her words.

  The Garden of Whispers waited—beautiful and expectant. Elise knelt by the pool, her paperbird
  flickering weakly beside her. The garden seemed to be asking: "What do you see? What do you
  truly see?" The pool showed Elise everything she'd seen but never said—all the silent observations,
  the noticed beauty, the understood truths. "Speak them," the garden whispered. But Elise's voice
  caught in her throat. She attempted to speak, but the words came out as barely a whisper. The
  paperbird flickered brighter for just a moment—but then faded again. Almost. She was almost
  there. Elise slumped in defeat. She'd tried to speak, but her voice was still too small, too
  scared. The paperbird pointed toward a distant cliff. Could she really do this?
