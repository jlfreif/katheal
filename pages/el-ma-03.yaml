      A dense grove where five rhythm-paths converge in a star pattern, all dark and broken.
      Elise stands at the center where the paths meet, trying basic dance moves—step, step,
      hop. The paths flicker weakly under her feet but won't hold the light. She's breathing
      hard, frustrated. Maya (9 years old, wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with pink streak,
      wearing light blue jeans and pink sweater) walks into the grove from another path, paint
      smudges on her hands. Both girls' eyes meet in surprise and recognition. The trees around
      them are twisted and ancient, golden threads hanging limp between branches. The air feels
      heavy with broken rhythm. The ground vibrates faintly with incomplete beats.

      Elise and Maya meet at a crossroads. "Maya?" "Elise?" They stared. Elise stepped simple patterns on the paths. The paths flickered but died. She tried faster. Nothing held. Footsteps.

    visual: |
      Elise and Maya dance on different paths, trying every basic move they know. Elise does
      clean pop-and-lock moves. Maya tries jazz steps with sharp precision. Both are moving
      fast, breathing hard, sweat on their foreheads. The paths flicker and sputter but won't
      stay lit. They stop, hands on knees, exhausted and frustrated. A small brown rabbit sits
      on a nearby rock, watching them with knowing eyes, ears twitching. The golden threads
      overhead pulse weakly, almost mockingly. The paths remain stubbornly dark. Behind them,
      deeper in the forest, more paths wait—but these paths look more complex, winding through
      the trees with intricate patterns.

      "Maybe together?" Maya tried jazz steps. Elise added hip-hop. They moved fast, harder. The paths flickered. Died. Both stopped, hands on knees, breathing hard. "We're doing it right," Elise said, frustrated. "Perfect technique." "But it's not working," Maya finished. A rabbit appeared on a rock, watching with knowing eyes. Basic moves weren't enough. They'd need something more.
