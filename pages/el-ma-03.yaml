    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Maya leaps high in the center of a faded meadow, arms stretched wide, hair
      with its pink streak flying as she spins with bold, explosive energy. Her
      movements are powerful and decisive. Grey flowers surround her, barely stirring.
      In the distance, another figure moves through the flowers with slow, graceful
      gestures—arms flowing like water, turning in lyrical circles.

      Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like wind
      itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life! Her feet pounded
      the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely stirred. She landed
      hard and spun again. Nothing. In the distance, someone moved through the grey
      blooms with slow, graceful turns.

    visual: |
      Elise stands in a graceful pose, arms extended, having just completed a flowing
      turn, as Maya bounds over mid-leap. Both girls freeze as recognition hits.
      Maya's expression shifts from determined to shocked to delighted. Elise's eyes
      widen with surprise and joy. Grey flowers surround them. Golden threads pulse
      overhead, connecting their presence.

      "Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop mid-leap. Her cousin looked up from her dance,
      arms still extended in a graceful line. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
      one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright and
      startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said at exactly
      the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if recognizing their connection.
