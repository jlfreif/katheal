    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Maya leaps and spins in the center of a faded meadow, her movements bold
      and energetic. She wears her signature pink-streaked hair flying as she
      dances, trying to bring life back through movement. Grey flowers surround
      her, unresponsive. In the distance, a figure with paint-stained hands
      kneels among the flowers.

      Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like
      wind itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life. Her
      feet pounded the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely
      stirred. She landed hard, breathing fast, and spun again. Nothing. In
      the distance, someone knelt among the grey blooms, moving carefully.

    visual: |
      Elise sits back on her heels, paintbrush lowering, as Maya bounds over.
      Both girls freeze mid-motion as recognition hits. Maya's expression shifts
      from determined to shocked to delighted. Elise's eyes widen with surprise
      and joy. Grey flowers surround them. Golden threads pulse overhead, connecting
      their presence.

      "Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop, dust flying. Her cousin looked up from
      her painting, eyes going wide. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
      one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright
      and startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said
      at exactly the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if
      recognizing their connection.
