    focus: Trying the obvious solution
    visual: |
      A meadow where vibrant flowers droop sadly, their colors muted and grey. Elise kneels
      beside a wilted patch of blooms, holding a small wooden watering can, pouring water onto
      the drooping petals. Maya (9 years old, wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with pink
      streak, wearing light blue jeans and pink sweater) walks into the scene from the right,
      carrying an armful of what looks like richer soil. Both girls' eyes meet in surprise and
      recognition. The background shows more faded flowers stretching across the meadow, a
      small stream winding through, and soft morning mist. The scene feels dull, waiting for
      life to return.

      Elise followed a path to a meadow where flowers had faded to grey. She poured water on the grey flowers. They stayed grey, drooping. Footsteps. "Maya?" Her cousin stood there with an armful of rich soil. "Elise? Is that really you?" They stared at each other. Then laughed, surprised and delighted.

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work
    visual: |
      Elise and Maya kneel side by side in the meadow, working together on the flowers. Maya
      pats fresh soil around the stems while Elise hums a gentle melody over them. The flowers
      remain stubbornly grey and drooping. Both girls sit back on their heels, expressions
      shifting from hope to puzzlement. A small brown rabbit sits nearby on a mossy rock,
      watching them with intelligent eyes, head tilted as if amused by their efforts. Golden
      threads shimmer faintly in the air above the meadow, barely visible. The sun climbs
      higher, lighting the scene with warm but muted tones.

      Maya added soil carefully. Elise sang softly over the stems. The flowers stayed stubbornly grey. A rabbit appeared on a rock and watched them with old, knowing eyes. "It's like they forgot how to be flowers," Maya said, frowning. Simple wasn't working. They would need to find another way.
