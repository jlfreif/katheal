      Maya's room in Madrid, walls covered with her bold, colorful artwork. Maya (9 years old,
      wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with distinctive pink streak, athletic build, wearing
      light blue jeans and pink sweater) stands before an easel, paintbrush in hand, working on
      a vibrant abstract painting. Paint splatters dot the floor in rainbow colors. Her art shows
      bold strokes and confident color choices—nothing timid or careful. Dance shoes hang on
      the wall beside Spanish vocabulary flashcards. Her expression shows fierce concentration
      and joy. The room reflects her personality: spirited, bold, authentic.

      Maya painted wild. Pink slashed across canvas, then blue, then orange without thinking. Her art teacher said plan carefully, but Maya's brush didn't wait for plans. The colors sang.

      The paint on Maya's canvas begins to glow and move, colors swirling on their own, lifting
      off the canvas into three-dimensional streams of light. Maya steps back, paintbrush frozen
      mid-air, eyes wide with amazement. The pink she just painted flows into the air like ribbon,
      the blue follows, the orange dances around them both. They weave together creating patterns
      more beautiful than she'd planned, forming words in the air: "Your colors need a bigger
      canvas." The window shimmers like a portal. The atmosphere crackles with colorful magic and
      unlimited possibility.

      The paint lifted off the canvas into the air. Maya gasped. Her colors danced together, weaving patterns she'd never imagined. Words formed in the swirling paint. "Your colors need a bigger canvas." One ribbon of pink curled around her wrist, tugging toward the window. She followed.
