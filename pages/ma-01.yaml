      Maya's room in Madrid, walls covered with her bold, colorful artwork. Maya (9 years old,
      wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with distinctive pink streak, athletic build, wearing
      light blue jeans and pink sweater) stands before an easel, paintbrush in hand, working on
      a vibrant abstract painting. Paint splatters dot the floor in rainbow colors. Her art shows
      bold strokes and confident color choices—nothing timid or careful. Dance shoes hang on
      the wall beside Spanish vocabulary flashcards. Her expression shows fierce concentration
      and joy. The room reflects her personality: spirited, bold, authentic.

      Maya slashed pink across the canvas, then added electric blue without hesitation. Her art
      teacher always said to plan compositions carefully, but Maya painted from her gut—bold,
      wild, completely herself. She grabbed orange next, swirling it through the pink. The colors
      sang together, bright and unafraid. This was how she thought, how she felt, how she showed
      the world who she really was.

      The paint on Maya's canvas begins to glow and move, colors swirling on their own, lifting
      off the canvas into three-dimensional streams of light. Maya steps back, paintbrush frozen
      mid-air, eyes wide with amazement. The pink she just painted flows into the air like ribbon,
      the blue follows, the orange dances around them both. They weave together creating patterns
      more beautiful than she'd planned, forming words in the air: "Your colors need a bigger
      canvas." Her room's walls seem to shimmer. The atmosphere crackles with colorful magic and
      unlimited possibility.

      The paint lifted off the canvas, flowing into the air like liquid light. Maya gasped as
      her colors danced together, weaving patterns she'd never imagined. Pink and blue and orange
      spiraled into words: "Your colors need a bigger canvas." The walls of her room shimmered,
      barely containing the magic. One ribbon of pink curled around her wrist, tugging playfully
      toward somewhere that could hold all her bold, authentic colors.
