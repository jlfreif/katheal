      Maya's room in Madrid, walls covered with her bold, colorful artwork. Maya (9 years old,
      wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with distinctive pink streak, athletic build, wearing
      light blue jeans and pink sweater) stands before an easel, paintbrush in hand, working on
      a portrait. She's painting quickly, confident strokes capturing surface appearance but
      missing deeper details. A sketchbook nearby shows quick judgments: "boring tree," "silly
      clouds." Dance shoes hang on the wall beside Spanish vocabulary flashcards. Her expression
      shows quick confidence. The room reflects someone who decides fast based on what she sees.

      Maya painted a portrait in ten minutes flat. She saw things quick. Tree? Boring. Clouds? Silly. People were easy too. Happy or sad, you could tell just by looking. Surfaces told you everything you needed to know.

      Her latest painting—a simple grey rock on canvas—suddenly shimmers and cracks open,
      revealing layers of brilliant crystals hidden inside. Maya steps back, eyes wide. The
      painted rock wasn't what it seemed at all. Light pours from the hidden crystals, forming
      words in the air: "What lies beneath?" A portal opens in her window showing a forest path.
      Maya stares, confused but intrigued. The grey rock she thought was boring holds entire
      universes inside. The atmosphere shifts from confident knowing to curious uncertainty.

      The grey rock she'd painted cracked open on the canvas. Inside, hidden crystals blazed with light. Maya blinked. The boring rock wasn't boring at all. Words formed in the light. "What lies beneath?" A path opened through her window. Maybe things weren't always what they seemed. She stepped through.
