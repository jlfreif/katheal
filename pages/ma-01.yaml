    visual: |
      Maya sits cross-legged on her bedroom floor surrounded by paint supplies,
      her pink-streaked sandy-blond hair catching afternoon light from the
      window. Bold colorful paintings cover the walls. She's painting a dance
      scene with energetic brushstrokes, tongue poking out in concentration.
      Music plays softly in the background.

      Maya's brush swept across the paper in bold strokes—bright pink, electric
      blue, sunshine yellow. She was painting a dancer mid-leap, all energy
      and motion. "That's not right," she muttered, adding more pink. Then
      more blue. The painting got louder, bolder, more Maya. Her cousin Elise
      would probably paint it gentle and perfect. But Maya liked it loud.

    focus: First hint of something different

    visual: |
      Maya freezes, paintbrush hovering, as the painted dancer on her paper
      begins to glow with golden light that has nothing to do with her paints.
      The glow pulses gently, inviting. Her eyes widen with delighted curiosity.
      Pink paint drips forgotten from her brush. The light seems to dance in
      rhythm with music only it can hear.

      The dancer on her paper started to glow. Maya blinked, but the light
      didn't fade. It pulsed softly, goldenly, moving like the figure wanted
      to dance right off the page. Her paint couldn't do that. She leaned
      closer, brush forgotten. The glow brightened as if responding to her
      attention. "Whoa," Maya breathed. "Are you magic?"
