      Front cover illustration. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build,
      blue hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) stands at the center, holding a glowing
      Rubik's cube in one hand while golden threads swirl around him, weaving into puzzle patterns,
      riddles, and mathematical sequences. His expression is excited and determined, eyes wide
      with curiosity. Behind him, the Library of Kathaél rises with shelves of glowing books
      and the massive Heart Crystal visible in the background, its facets refracting golden light.
      More golden threads flow from the Crystal toward Noah, forming constellation symbols and
      word riddles in the air. His notebook is tucked under his arm, pages fluttering with game
      designs. The atmosphere is luminous and adventurous, with watercolor washes of honey golds,
      warm creams, and mist blues. Delicate ink linework defines the threads and architectural
      details. The scene captures Noah's analytical nature meeting magical wonder.

      At the top of the cover, in elegant script: "The Library of Kathaél"
      Below that, in bold lettering: "Noah's Journey"
      At the bottom: "Courage to Keep Going After a Mistake"
