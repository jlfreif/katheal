      Noah kneels at the edge of the Whispering Woods, where massive oak trees create a natural
      archway. His fingers brush away moss and fallen leaves from something metal embedded in
      the earth. Afternoon light filters through the canopy, creating dappled patterns on the
      forest floor. His expression shows concentrated curiosity—tongue slightly out, sandy blond
      hair falling across his forehead. Small mushrooms and wildflowers surround the spot.

      At the forest's edge, Noah found it: a compass made of tarnished brass and crystal,
      half-buried like it had been waiting centuries. His fingers tingled when he touched it.

      Noah holds the Cartographer's Compass up to the light. The compass is ornate—brass outer
      ring with intricate engravings, a crystal face that swirls with faint golden mist, and a
      needle that shimmers between blue and gold. His eyes are wide with wonder, mouth slightly
      open. The needle spins wildly for a moment, then points directly into the darkest, most
      mysterious part of the woods. Behind him, the safe, sunny meadow contrasts with the shadowy
      forest ahead.

      The compass needle spun once, twice, then locked onto a direction—straight into the
      deepest part of the woods. Noah's heart raced. This wasn't pointing to anywhere safe.
      But something about it felt...right.
