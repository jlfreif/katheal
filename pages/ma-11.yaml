      The Heart Crystal blazes with every color imaginable, the performance
      facet spinning and dancing with light. Maya's authentic performance
      weaves into the structure, its wild energy making the whole crystal
      more vibrant. Between her hands appears a small paint pot filled with
      colors that shift and glow. The butterfly from before circles, wings
      brilliant.

      The Crystal blazed with every color Maya had ever loved and some she'd
      never imagined. Her wild authentic performance wove itself into the
      pattern, and somehow its boldness made everything more beautiful. Light
      gathered in her palms until a paint pot appeared—small, perfect, filled
      with colors that glowed and shifted. The butterfly landed on her shoulder,
      wings brilliant. "I was always enough," Maya breathed.

    visual: |
      Maya walks home along a path lined with performing flowers and dancing
      trees, the paint pot secure in her hands. Around her, frozen performances
      complete themselves—each one unique, authentic, true. A fox dances past.
      Her Madrid bedroom window glows warmly in the distance, her bold paintings
      visible through the glass.

      Maya walked home, the paint pot warm in her hands. All around, frozen
      performances finished themselves—each dancer finding their own style,
      each artist creating their own truth. A fox danced past and Maya laughed,
      spinning with it. "Thank you," she called to Kathaél. The window to her
      bedroom gleamed ahead, her bold colorful paintings waiting.
