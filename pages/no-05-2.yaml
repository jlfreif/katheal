      Noah walks past Bramblebeard into the inner grove. Bramblebeard calls after him, one hand
      raised in warning. Around them, the forest begins to shift—subtle at first. Shadows lengthen
      despite the afternoon sun. Flowers start closing. Paperbirds fly hurriedly toward roosts.
      Noah glances back, worried. Bramblebeard's expression shows genuine concern beneath the
      gruffness.

      "Wait!" Bramblebeard's voice followed him. "The woods shift at twilight. If you haven't
      found your answer by sunset, the paths will close. You'll be lost until morning."
      Noah's heartbeat quickened.

      Noah breaks into a run toward the Singing Stones visible in the distance—a circle of
      tall iridescent pillars humming with barely audible music. His compass glows brighter,
      pointing urgently forward. The sun sits lower on the horizon now, painting everything
      in amber and shadow. Noah's expression shows determination mixed with rising panic.
      Leaves swirl behind him. Time is running out.

      Noah ran. The compass pulsed faster, matching his heartbeat. Ahead, the Singing Stones
      hummed their mysterious melody. He had to reach them before dark—before the woods closed
      their secrets away.
