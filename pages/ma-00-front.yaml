      Front cover illustration. Maya (9 years old, wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair
      with a distinctive pink strip, medium height, balanced build, athletic, light blue
      jeans, pink sweater, white sneakers) stands in a bold, confident pose, holding a
      paintbrush that trails golden threads and vibrant colors through the air. Her
      expression is spirited and determined, eyes bright with creative fire. Golden threads
      swirl around her, transforming into dance ribbons, paint strokes, and performance
      spotlights. Behind her, the Library of Kathaél glows warmly, and the Heart Crystal
      rises majestically, its facets reflecting rainbow colors that match her artistic
      energy. Some faded gray elements are being painted back to life with golden-touched
      colors. The atmosphere is bold and expressive, with watercolor washes of vibrant
      pinks, honey golds, warm creams, and jewel tones. Delicate ink linework defines the
      flowing threads and magical elements. The scene captures Maya's artistic boldness
      meeting magical possibility.

      At the top of the cover, in elegant script: "The Library of Kathaél"
      Below that, in bold lettering: "Maya's Journey"
      At the bottom: "Courage to Be Yourself"
