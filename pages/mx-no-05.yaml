      A clearing littered with broken crystal fragments and frayed golden threads hanging in the air.
      Noah enters from one side, looking alarmed at the wreckage. Max stands at the opposite edge,
      notebook in hand, equally overwhelmed. They spot each other across the clearing. Both wear
      similar expressions of shock and surprise. A crow perches on a twisted branch above. Forest
      surrounds the devastated clearing. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah entered a clearing full of broken crystals. Someone had tried to fix things and failed. Badly. Footsteps. "Max?" His cousin stood at the clearing's edge. "Is that you?" Max's eyes went wide. "Noah! What are you doing here?" A crow cackled from above. "Ah, more helpers. Perfect."

    focus: Encountering misleading help

    visual: |
      Max and Noah stand face to face, both holding notebooks covered in crossed-out attempts. The
      crow gestures wildly at the brightest thread. Max and Noah exchange uncertain glances. The
      crow grabs the thread and yanks. It snaps. Grey dust scatters. The thread dies instantly.
      The crow squawks and flees. Both boys step back, recognizing the mistake. Text in Times New
      Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      "Just grab that bright thread and pull," the crow said. "Easy!" Max narrowed his eyes. "That seems too simple?" Noah hesitated. "Maybe simple is what we're missing?" The crow grabbed the thread. Yanked. It snapped. Grey dust. The crow squawked and fled. Max and Noah stared at their notebooks full of crossed-out plans. "We keep trying to control it," Noah said slowly. "Force it to work." Max nodded. "But maybe... we need to try differently. Keep going, but change how." Something deeper in the forest pulsed. The real test waited ahead.
