      Max stands at the edge of a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads
      hang suspended, all frayed and flickering. He holds a notebook filled with
      diagrams and systems for solving the problem. His expression shows alarm at
      the scale. In the distance, another figure with a notebook approaches, looking
      equally overwhelmed.

      The clearing stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen stories hung in
      the air, all fraying at the edges. Max gripped his notebook tighter, systems
      and diagrams filling every page. He'd tried organizing them by type, by
      pattern, by structure. Nothing worked. The Crystal pulsed dimmer in the
      distance. A flower nearby turned to dust. "This is really bad."

    focus: Encountering misleading help

    visual: |
      Max and Noah stand face to face, both holding notebooks covered in crossed-out
      attempts. Behind them, a storyteller in a patched coat gestures wildly at
      a flowchart, his formulaic approach causing a thread to smoke and knot.
      Both boys step back simultaneously, recognizing their own mistakes in
      the storyteller's methods.

      "You want to help stories? I have the formula!" The storyteller lunged
      forward, grabbing threads. "Twelve steps, perfectly predictable!" A thread
      writhed and knotted, smoking. Max and another boy with sandy hair dove
      forward at the same time. "Stop!" they shouted together. They looked at
      each other, both breathing hard, both holding notebooks. The other boy's
      eyes widened. "You've been trying to analyze them too?"
