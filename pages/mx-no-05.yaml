      A clearing filled with floating puzzle fragments. Constellation pieces. Word tiles. Numbers.
      Musical notes. Gear mechanisms. All jumbled and chaotic. Noah enters from one side, notebook
      full of crossed-out attempts. Max stands at the opposite edge, also holding a notebook with
      similar failures. They spot each other across the clearing. Both wear expressions of surprise.

      Noah and Max each followed their threads until they entered a clearing full of puzzle fragments. "Max?" Noah stated with surprise. "Is that you?" Max's eyes went wide. "Noah! What are you doing here?" A crow smiled from above. "Ah, the team grows. Perfect."

    focus: Encountering misleading help
    visual: |
      Max and Noah stand face to face, both holding notebooks covered in analytical notes and crossed-
      out attempts. The crow gestures wildly at the brightest glowing piece. "Skip the hard parts!"
      it caws. "Just grab that one!" Max and Noah exchange uncertain glances. The crow swoops down,
      grabs the bright piece, and yanks it. The entire pattern collapses. Fragments scatter. Grey dust.

      "Skip the hard parts!" the crow said. Max frowned. "That seems too simple?" Noah hesitated. Noah and Max stared at their pages of overthinking. "We keep trying to find the perfect plan," Noah said slowly. "But maybe we just need to try things. Learn as we go." Something deeper in the forest pulsed. The real challenges waited ahead.
