      Max follows a golden thread deeper into the Kathaél forest. The scale expands dramatically -
      hundreds of broken challenge courses stretch in every direction between enormous trees. All
      are dark and lifeless. The Heart Crystal looms in the distance, much larger than before,
      cracks spreading like spiderwebs across its surface. A flower nearby withers to dust,
      showing the urgency of the crisis. Max's expression shows his stomach tightening - this is
      bigger than he thought. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max followed a golden thread deeper into Kathaél. More courses stretched in every direction, all broken, all dark. The Heart Crystal loomed ahead, bigger than he'd realized, cracks spreading like spiderwebs. A flower nearby withered to dust. The air felt wrong. Max's stomach tightened. This wasn't just about one course. This was everything.

    visual: |
      Noah appears from another path, sandy hair messy, looking equally surprised to see Max. The
      two cousins face each other in the magical forest. Behind them, broken courses stretch in
      different directions showing they've each been working on separate challenges. Both wear
      expressions of shock and recognition - "What are YOU doing here?" They're surrounded by the
      failing magic of Kathaél, but there's relief in finding family. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      "Max?" A familiar voice. Max spun. Noah stood there, sandy hair messy, looking as surprised as Max felt. "Noah?! What are YOU doing here?" They stared at each other. Cousins meeting in an impossible magical forest. "I'm trying to fix these courses," Noah said. Max pointed at his own broken course. "Same. This is way harder than it looks." Noah grinned. "Want to compare notes?"
