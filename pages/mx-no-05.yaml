      Noah runs through a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads hang suspended,
      all frayed and flickering. He holds his notebook against his chest as he moves.
      Ahead, a storyteller in a patched coat gestures wildly at threads, and where he
      touches them, they smoke and writhe. Another boy with red hair and a notebook
      sprints toward the same scene from a different path.

      The clearing stretched impossibly wide, hundreds of frozen stories hanging in the
      air. Noah ran forward, breath catching. "This is... there are so many." A man in
      a patched coat was grabbing threads, and they smoked under his touch. "You want
      to help stories? I have the formula!" the storyteller shouted. "Twelve steps,
      perfectly predictable!" A thread knotted violently, and Noah skidded to a stop.

    focus: Encountering misleading help

    visual: |
      Max and Noah both dive forward simultaneously, reaching to stop the storyteller
      from touching more threads. A thread behind them explodes into sparks, forcing
      them to duck. Both boys stumble backward, panting, holding notebooks covered
      in crossed-out attempts. Behind them, the storyteller's formula-chart burns
      and crumbles.

      The storyteller lunged for another thread, and both boys dove forward. "Stop!"
      they shouted together. A thread sparked and whipped past Noah's ear. He ducked,
      stumbled, and crashed into someone with red hair. They both fell, breathing
      hard. "You've been trying to analyze them too?" the other boy gasped, holding
      up a notebook identical to Noah's. Noah laughed, breathless. "Yeah. And it's
      not working."
