    visual: |
      A vast clearing littered with broken crystal fragments that catch the light in rainbow
      flashes. Tangled golden threads lie across the ground like discarded string, knotted and
      dull. Max (12 years old, straight red hair parted down the middle, tall and slim, wearing
      black t-shirt and light blue basketball shorts) stands examining a cluster of threads,
      his expression analytical. Noah enters the clearing from another direction, stopping when
      he sees the chaos. A large glossy black crow perches on a broken crystal pillar, watching
      them with shrewd, knowing eyes. The clearing feels like a graveyard of failed attempts.
      The forest beyond seems to close in around this open space.

      Max stared at the mess of threads and broken crystals scattered across the clearing.
      Someone had tried to fix things here and failed badly. Footsteps made him turn. Another
      boy, about his age, stopped at the clearing's edge, taking in the same wreckage. A crow
      cackled from above. "Ah, more helpers. Perfect."

    focus: Encountering misleading help
    visual: |
      The crow swoops down between Max and Noah, its wings spread wide, beak open as it talks
      confidently. One wing points dramatically at the largest, brightest golden thread hanging
      in the air above them. Max crosses his arms, head tilted skeptically, eyebrows raised.
      Noah leans forward, hand on his chin, looking torn between doubt and hope. The thread the
      crow indicates pulses enticingly but something about it feels off—too bright, too easy.
      The broken crystals at their feet seem to warn against simple solutions. Shadows lengthen
      across the clearing.

      "You're overthinking it, boys," the crow said smoothly, gesturing at the brightest thread.
      "Just grab that one and pull. Easy!" Max's eyes narrowed. "That seems... too simple?"
      But Noah hesitated. "Maybe simple is what we're missing?" The crow's eyes glinted. Before
      they could decide, it grabbed the thread itself and yanked. The thread snapped instantly,
      scattering into dull grey dust. The crow squawked and fled.
