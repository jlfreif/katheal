      Max stands at the edge of a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads
      hang suspended, all frayed and flickering. He holds a notebook filled with
      diagrams and systems for solving the problem. His expression shows alarm at
      the scale. In the distance, another figure with a notebook approaches, looking
      equally overwhelmed.

      Noah entered a clearing littered with broken crystal fragments. Someone had tried to fix things here and failed badly. Footsteps made him turn. Max stopped at the clearing's edge, taking in the same wreckage. A crow cackled from above. "Ah, more helpers. Perfect."

    focus: Encountering misleading help

    visual: |
      Max and Noah stand face to face, both holding notebooks covered in crossed-out
      attempts. Behind them, a storyteller in a patched coat gestures wildly at
      a flowchart, his formulaic approach causing a thread to smoke and knot.
      Both boys step back simultaneously, recognizing their own mistakes in
      the storyteller's methods.

      "You're overthinking it, boys," the crow said smoothly, gesturing at the brightest thread. "Just grab that one and pull. Easy!" Max's eyes narrowed. "That seems too simple?" But Noah hesitated. "Maybe simple is what we're missing?" Before they could decide, the crow grabbed the thread itself and yanked. The thread snapped instantly, scattering into dull grey dust. The crow squawked and fled.
