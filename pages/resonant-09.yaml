      Elise remembers the fading meadow, the frozen performances, the stories losing
      color. Not because she has to fix them, but because they matter to her.
      That care rekindl es her resolve.
    manifestation: |
      Her shoulders straighten. Her breathing deepens. She places her hand over
      her heart and feels warmth spreading through her chest. Her eyes clear with
      renewed purpose.

    emotional_state: renewed courage
    trigger: |
      Noah realizes that trying to understand everything before acting kept him
      paralyzed. He can choose to be present even without perfect answers. That
      shift opens new possibilities.
    manifestation: |
      His jaw sets with determination. He closes his notebook, no longer needing
      to analyze every detail. He looks at the path ahead with fresh eyes, seeing
      possibility where before he saw only obstacles.

      As Elise's determination solidifies into quiet resolve, Noah - far away in

      as if someone believes in his journey. The air around him brightens subtly.

      As Noah's courage returns through choosing presence over understanding, Elise -
      in her distant grove - notices the shadows become less oppressive. A gentle
      breeze carries something that feels like encouragement from someone who
      understands her path.

# Symbolic resonance phenomenon
symbolic_resonance:
  phenomenon: golden_thread_shimmer
  description: |
    The Heart Crystal's threads, usually flowing invisibly through Kathaél,
    briefly shimmer into visibility across the entire realm. Both characters,
    in different locations, see the same golden light pulse through the air,
    connecting their moments of courageous choice.
  manifestation_details:
    - Golden threads appear in the air, pulsing gently with heartbeat rhythm
    - The light is warm, reassuring, alive
    - It persists for several heartbeats before fading
    - Characters may not understand intellectually what happened, but they feel less alone
    - The threads form subtle patterns suggesting connection to others making brave choices
    - A sense of being part of something larger than themselves

# Connection to world themes
world_connection: |
  This resonant moment embodies Kathaél's Courage Rule: when one heart chooses
  bravely, ripples spread through the Heart Crystal, strengthening others who
  are also being brave. Elise and Noah's inner shifts create golden threads
  that flow into the Crystal and pulse outward, connecting their courage even
  across distance. They're learning that honest presence creates connection,
  even without understanding how.
