    connecting their separate moments of choice.

    - Golden threads appear in the air, pulsing gently with warm light
    - The light feels reassuring and alive
    - It fades after several heartbeats, leaving a sense of connection
    - Neither character fully understands what happened, but both feel less alone
    - The threads seem to acknowledge their courage

world_connection: |

  strengthens everyone else choosing the same.
