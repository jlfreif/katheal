  The paperbird suddenly darts off the main path, diving into a thicket of flowering vines.
  Ellie laughs and waves to Noah, already turning to chase it. "That way for me!" she calls
  over her shoulder. Noah stands alone now at a smaller fork, holding his compass. But
  something has shifted—his posture is straighter, his expression more determined than
  anxious. Ellie's warmth lingers like sunlight. The paperbird flashes once between the trees,
  and she's gone.

  Noah jumped as someone burst through the trees—his sister Ellie, giggling and breathless.
  "The paths crossed us again!" she said, eyes bright. Noah clutched his spinning compass tighter.
  "Why are you waiting?" Ellie asked, tilting her head. "Just pick one!" "What if it's the wrong
  one?" Noah's voice cracked slightly. Ellie grinned and squeezed his shoulder. "Then we'll find
  another. Paths aren't trapped doors, Noah." They walked together for a few steps. "See? You
  picked one!" Ellie squeezed his hand. Noah glanced at his compass—it had settled, pointing
  forward. Maybe choosing itself was the magic. "Pick the one that scares you most—that's usually
  the interesting one!" Ellie called as she darted after her paperbird. Noah stood alone again,
  but this time he wasn't frozen. He chose the path his compass showed, and started walking.
