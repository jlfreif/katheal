      Evening falls. Noah stands at his window looking out at the Whispering Woods, which shimmer
      with familiar golden light. But this time, he's not watching for signals—he's remembering.
      His hand rests over his heart where the compass now lives as warmth and certainty. The feather
      charm's essence glows faintly beneath his fingers. In the distance, he can see tiny lights—
      maybe other children beginning their own journeys. His expression shows gentle pride.

      The woods still called to Noah, but differently now. Not "come get lost"—but "come explore."
      He touched his chest where the compass lived inside him. Its lesson was simple: trust yourself,
      choose anyway, keep walking.

      Noah sits cross-legged on his bed, ukulele in his lap, playing a soft melody he composed about
      his journey. On his nightstand: the sprouting acorn, a completed story notebook, a sketch Ellie
      made of the Singing Stones. Through the window, stars begin to appear. Noah looks peaceful,
      whole, different from the anxious boy who sat paralyzed by choices. He sets down the ukulele
      and picks up a fresh notebook. On the first page, he writes: "Chapter One: The Choice." The
      Whispering Woods hum in harmony.

      Noah began a new story—not because he had to, but because he wanted to. Each word a choice,
      each choice a path forward. The compass inside him pulsed gently: "You know the way now."
      And he did.
