      A dense part of the Library where musical note challenges grow incredibly difficult. Glowing
      musical staffs float in the air, showing complex rhythm combinations. Elise stands beneath
      them, breathing hard, sweat dripping down her face. Her white sneakers are scuffed from hours
      of dancing to unlock the notes. The path ahead shows spiraling staircases between ancient
      trees where books chime with difficult beats. A silver crow sits on a floating scroll beside
      an easier-looking path that branches off. This path has simple, basic note patterns glowing
      softly. The crow watches her with intelligent, gleaming eyes. Its feathers shimmer like

      Elise followed golden threads deeper into the Library. The musical notes pedestal sent her hunting for rhythm challenges. The patterns grew harder. Triple spins to unlock eighth notes. Rapid sequences for crescendos. Her legs burned. Sweat dripped. Hours of dancing. A silver crow sat on a scroll beside a different path—one with easy note patterns. Simple beats. "Lost?" it asked, voice smooth. "I know the shortcut."

      The silver crow steps confidently onto the easy shortcut path, demonstrating simple dance
      moves. "See?" it says. "No effort required." The crow does a few basic steps and musical
      notes light up beneath its talons. But then suddenly the notes turn RED and SHATTER like
      glass. The whole shortcut path crumbles, dropping the crow into darkness below. Its cry
      echoes then fades. The broken path dissolves to nothing. Elise stands at the edge, eyes wide,
      heart pounding. Golden threads pulse brighter, pointing firmly toward the difficult path with
      complex rhythms—the real path. Her legs still ache, but she knows now there are no shortcuts.
      Only the hard way forward.

      The crow stepped onto the easy path. "See? No effort required." Simple steps. The notes lit up. Then turned RED. The whole path shattered like glass. The crow dropped into darkness. Its cry faded. The broken shortcut crumbled to nothing. Elise's heart pounded. The golden threads pointed firmly at the hard path—the real one. Her legs ached. But there were no shortcuts. Only the way forward.
