      A dense part of the forest where trees grow twisted and strange, their trunks spiraling
      upward, branches creating a canopy that blocks most light. The path beneath Elise's feet
      shifts subtly, stones rearranging themselves. She walks carefully, hands out for balance,
      eyes wide as she takes in the strangeness. Glowing mushrooms dot the shadows. Whispers
      seem to come from the trees themselves. A silver fox sits on a moss-covered boulder ahead,
      watching her with intelligent, gleaming eyes. Its fur shimmers like mercury. The atmosphere
      feels both beautiful and untrustworthy. Elise's posture shows caution mixed with curiosity.

      The deeper forest felt different. Trees twisted in ways that made no sense, paths shifted
      when she wasn't looking, and whispers drifted through leaves that shouldn't be able to speak.
      Elise moved carefully, each step uncertain. A silver fox appeared on a boulder, its eyes
      too knowing, its smile too wide. "Lost?" it asked smoothly. "I know all the shortcuts."

    focus: Encountering misleading help
    visual: |
      The silver fox gestures with one paw toward a shimmering portal that appears in the air—a
      circle of swirling colors promising an easy path. Elise stands before it, hands clasped
      together uncertainly, tilting her head as she studies both the portal and the fox. The
      fox's expression is confident and persuasive. Through the portal, she can see what looks
      like the Heart Crystal, close and easy to reach. But something about the portal's edges
      flicker wrongly, colors not quite natural. Elise's face shows the internal debate between
      wanting the easy answer and trusting her instincts. The atmosphere is tense with decision.

      The fox waved its paw and a portal shimmered open, showing the Heart Crystal just steps
      away. "Why struggle when you can skip ahead?" it purred. Elise's heart wanted to believe
      it. But her body knew better—the portal's edges flickered wrong, like a dance step out of
      rhythm. Before she could decide, the fox stepped through. The portal snapped shut with a
      sharp crack, and the fox's yelp echoed before fading. Some shortcuts led nowhere good.
