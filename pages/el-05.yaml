      A dense part of the forest where the rhythm-path becomes incredibly difficult. The footprint
      patterns ahead show complex combinations—spin while leaping, land into a slide, pop up into
      rapid steps. Elise stands at the edge, breathing hard, sweat dripping down her face. Her
      white sneakers are scuffed and dirty. The path stretches ahead through twisted trees, their
      trunks spiraling upward. She's been dancing for hours and her legs ache. A silver fox sits
      on a moss-covered boulder beside an easier-looking path that branches off—this path has
      simple, basic footprints. The fox watches her with intelligent, gleaming eyes. Its fur
      shimmers like mercury. The atmosphere feels both beautiful and untrustworthy.

      Elise followed the golden threads deeper into Kathaél. The rhythm-path grew harder. Spin while leaping. Slide. Rapid steps. Her legs burned. Sweat dripped. Hours of dancing. A silver fox sat on a boulder beside a different path—one with easy footprints. Simple steps. "Lost?" it asked, voice smooth. "I know the shortcut."

      The silver fox steps confidently onto the easy shortcut-path, demonstrating the simple
      moves. "See?" it says. "No effort required." The fox does a few basic steps and the path
      lights up beneath its paws—but then suddenly CRACKS appear, spreading fast. The whole
      shortcut-path shatters like glass, dropping the fox into darkness below. Its yelp echoes
      then fades. The broken path crumbles away to nothing. Elise stands at the edge, eyes wide,
      heart pounding. The golden threads pulse brighter, pointing firmly toward the difficult
      path—the real path. Her legs still ache, but she knows now there are no shortcuts. Only
      the hard way forward.

      The fox stepped onto the easy path. "See? No effort required." Simple steps. The path lit up. Then CRACK. The whole path shattered like glass. The fox dropped into darkness. Its yelp faded. The broken shortcut crumbled to nothing. Elise's heart pounded. The golden threads pointed firmly at the hard path—the real one. Her legs ached. But there were no shortcuts. Only the way forward.
