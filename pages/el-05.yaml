beat: "Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)"

hook: Questionable character offers confident solution, creating doubt about whether to trust them.
payoff: The suggested solution fails spectacularly and obviously wrong.

description: Elise meets a dazzling artist-spirit who insists that bold, loud colors are the answer, but the approach feels wrong to her gentle nature.

      Elise stands at the edge of a circular plaza where the fading is severe. Trees
      that should shimmer are nearly grey, the ground dull and lifeless. Her watercolor
      set hangs from her wrist as she surveys the damaged landscape. Golden threads
      overhead are barely visible, thin as spider silk. Her posture shows quiet concern.

      The plaza looked worse than anywhere else. Trees stood grey as pencil sketches,
      their shimmer completely gone. The ground, which should have glowed, was as
      dull as pavement. Elise clutched her watercolor set to her chest, her heart
      sinking. If her gentle approach couldn't help a single flower, how could she
      possibly restore all of this?

    visual: |
      A dramatic figure draped in clashing scarves of electric purple, harsh orange,
      and screaming pink gestures wildly with giant paint-dripping brushes. Behind
      the spirit, trees have been "restored" with garish, unnatural colors that clash
      with each other. Elise takes a small step backward, one hand raised, her
      expression showing polite uncertainty.

      "Bold!" The artist-spirit swept enormous brushes through the air, splattering
      neon colors everywhere. "Loud! That's how you fix fading!" Elise looked at
      the trees the spirit had painted: harsh orange, electric purple, colors that
      hurt to see. The watching animals had fled. Something in Elise's chest pulled
      tight. This felt wrong. Very wrong.
