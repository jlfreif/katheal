      A dense part of the forest where trees grow twisted and strange, their trunks spiraling
      upward, branches creating a canopy that blocks most light. The path beneath Elise's feet
      shifts subtly, stones rearranging themselves. She walks carefully, hands out for balance,
      eyes wide as she takes in the strangeness. Glowing mushrooms dot the shadows. Whispers
      seem to come from the trees themselves. A silver fox sits on a moss-covered boulder ahead,
      watching her with intelligent, gleaming eyes. Its fur shimmers like mercury. The atmosphere
      feels both beautiful and untrustworthy. Elise's posture shows caution mixed with curiosity.

      The golden threads led Elise deeper where the forest grew strange. Paths shifted. Trees whispered. A silver fox sat on a boulder ahead, fur shimmering like mercury. "Lost?" it asked, voice smooth as silk. "I know all the shortcuts."

    focus: Encountering misleading help
    visual: |
      The silver fox gestures with one paw toward a shimmering portal that appears in the air—a
      circle of swirling colors promising an easy path. Elise stands before it, hands clasped
      together uncertainly, tilting her head as she studies both the portal and the fox. The
      fox's expression is confident and persuasive. Through the portal, she can see what looks
      like the Heart Crystal, close and easy to reach. But something about the portal's edges
      flicker wrongly, colors not quite natural. Elise steps back, shaking her head. The atmosphere
      is tense with decision.

      The fox waved its paw. A portal opened in the air, swirling colors. "Skip ahead," it purred. "Why walk when you can fly?" The edges flickered wrong. Elise's stomach twisted. The fox stepped through confident. The portal snapped shut with a crack. The fox's yelp faded to nothing. Elise backed away slow. The threads showed another path. She'd walk.
