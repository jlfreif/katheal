      Elise kneels at the pool's edge, the fading paperbird hovering just above the water,
      nearly transparent now—this is its last moment. The entire garden waits in complete
      stillness. Elise closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and begins to speak—not shouting,
      not performing, just speaking her truth clearly and gently: "I see you. I see how you're
      made of stories that people forgot to tell. I see how you carry the words that were too
      quiet to be heard." Her voice echoes softly through the garden.

      Elise spoke, her voice gentle but clear: "I see you—made of whispered stories, quiet truths,
      observations no one thought to share. You carry what silent watchers know. And I see that
      matters."

      As Elise speaks, the flowers in the garden begin to glow, growing brighter with each word.
      The pool's surface ripples with light. Most importantly, the paperbird begins to solidify—
      its edges becoming crisp and clear, its colors flooding back brilliantly: sapphire blue,
      sunset gold, forest green, rose pink. It flies up in spirals of joy, wings catching starlight,
      fully alive again. Elise continues speaking her observations, her truths, and with each word
      the paperbird grows more vibrant. She's crying with relief and joy. Her voice saved it.

      The paperbird blazed to life—colors flooding back in brilliant waves. Elise kept speaking,
      words flowing easily now: "Quiet voices matter. Gentle observations hold power. Small acts
      of care change worlds." The paperbird danced in celebration.
