      The eagle demonstrates, climbing up the tower with Micah following close behind. The eagle
      keeps its eyes on the next hold, never looking down, moving with confident grace. Micah
      copies the movement—eyes up, hands reaching for the next grip, feet finding solid holds.
      He climbs ten feet higher than where he'd frozen, focused on the eagle's technique. When
      he starts to glance down, the eagle's wing blocks his view. "Forward, not down." Micah's
      movements grow steadier. His expression shows cautious growing confidence. The atmosphere
      is learning through imitation, fear temporarily forgotten in focus.

      The eagle climbed and Micah followed. Eyes on the next hold. Hands reaching up. Feet pushing up. Not down. Never down. Micah climbed higher than before, focused on following. The eagle glowed. "Better. But you need real practice."

    focus: Receiving direction with warning

      The eagle points its wing toward a distant cliff face rising from the forest—natural rock,
      rough and challenging, perfect for climbing practice. It's lower than the tower but still
      impressively high, with a clear path to the summit. Golden threads stretch from the tower
      toward the cliff, showing the way. The eagle looks at Micah seriously. "This is where you
      learn courage. Climb the cliff. Reach the summit. Eyes forward, not down. Face your fear
      in a smaller challenge first." Micah stares at the cliff, stomach tight with anxiety but
      also determination. His expression shows nervous readiness. The atmosphere is the edge of
      real challenge.

      The eagle pointed toward a cliff rising from the forest. Not as high as the tower, but high enough to be scary. "Practice there," it said. "Face the heights. Reach the summit. Then you'll be ready for the tower." Golden threads blazed a path toward the cliff. Micah took a breath. Okay. He could try. Eyes forward, not down.
