      Micah sits on a platform in the Library studying the mechanical course carefully, watching the
      patterns of movement. The gears move in sequences—three seconds stable, then shift. He counts on
      his fingers, watches timing, analyzes the rhythm like solving a puzzle. The silver fox sits nearby,
      tail swishing patiently. Micah's expression shows focused concentration—using his brain as well
      as his body. Around him, glowing markers show the timing patterns he's identifying. Floating
      scrolls chime softly. The atmosphere shows problem-solving intelligence—treating the challenge
      as a puzzle to crack.

      Following his crash, Micah decided to study the course. The mechanisms moved in patterns—he could see that. Three seconds stable, then shift. He could time it. He started counting, watching, memorizing the rhythm. Micah nodded. "I've got this."

      Micah runs the course again with perfect timing—counting, jumping at exact intervals. He makes
      it halfway through successfully, mechanisms glowing as he crosses. His expression shows triumph.
      But then the pattern suddenly changes. The mechanisms switch to a new rhythm. New obstacles appear.
      The balance beam splits into three paths. The gear system moves to a different location. Micah
      freezes mid-course, shocked. The fox tilts its head. A carved marker nearby glows with mysterious
      words: "Time moves. You must move with it. But moving isn't always movement." The atmosphere shows
      at bottom.

      Micah ran the course again, timing every move perfectly. Jump. Three counts. Shift. Jump. It worked! He made it halfway through before the pattern changed. The mechanisms switched to a new rhythm. "Oh, come ON!" he shouted. The fox tilted its head. Beside it, a carved marker glowed with words: "Time moves. You must move with it. But moving isn't always movement."
