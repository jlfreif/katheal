      The crane demonstrates slow, deliberate movement—lifting one leg gracefully, holding the
      pose, breathing steadily, then setting it down with perfect control. Each movement is
      intentional, powerful through precision not speed. Micah watches from sitting position,
      still catching his breath, trying to understand. The crane's calmness radiates outward in
      golden ripples. Micah's restless energy contrasts sharply with the crane's centered peace.
      His expression shows frustrated confusion—this goes against everything he knows. The
      atmosphere is teaching through contrast.

      The crane moved one leg. Slowly. So slowly. Then placed it down. Each movement was
      deliberate, powerful, complete. "Breath first," it said. "Then movement. Never movement
      without breath. Speed without stillness is just chaos." Micah fidgeted, already wanting
      to move. "But how do I learn to be still? I don't know how." The crane's eyes were kind
      but serious.

    visual: |
      The crane points one wing toward a distant garden barely visible through mist—a place so
      quiet and still it seems to shimmer with enforced peace. Wind chimes hang motionless despite
      breeze. Everything is deliberate, slow, centered. Micah stares at it with visible dread,
      his whole body already tensing against the idea. The crane watches him with patient
      understanding. The atmosphere is heavy with difficult challenge—this will be the hardest
      thing Micah has ever done. Not because it's physically demanding, but because it requires
      him to stop.

      The crane pointed toward a garden in the distance, where everything moved slow as honey,
      where wind chimes hung silent and stillness was required. "There. Learn to breathe. Learn
      to pause. Learn to be still." Micah's stomach dropped. Running until exhausted was easy
      compared to this. His body already itched to move. "I don't think I can." The crane nodded.
      "That's why you must. The hardest courage is not moving when you want to."
