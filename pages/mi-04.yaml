    visual: |
      Micah kneels before an ancient tortoise with a shell covered in glowing moss and tiny
      luminous mushrooms. The tortoise sits perfectly still beside a quiet pond that reflects
      the trees above. Micah's body shows restless energy even while kneeling: one foot tapping,
      fingers drumming on his leg, shoulders tense. The tortoise regards him with calm, ancient
      eyes. Golden threads drift peacefully in the background, drawn to the tortoise's stillness.
      Micah leans forward impatiently, wanting answers NOW.

      Micah found a tortoise older than the trees. "Please," he said, trying to sit still but
      already bouncing on his knees. "How do I fix the threads?" The tortoise blinked slowly.
      "The threads respond to presence, not pressure. You must learn to..." Micah shifted,
      tapped his foot, cracked his knuckles. Being still felt like holding his breath underwater.

    focus: Receiving direction with warning

    visual: |
      The tortoise gestures with one ancient foot toward a path that leads into a dense,
      shadowy part of the forest where threads hang thick and troubled. Micah has already
      stood up, ready to bolt toward it, body coiled with energy. The tortoise's expression
      shows gentle concern. A warning hangs in the air like mist. The path ahead looks
      tangled and chaotic, matching Micah's internal state. Threads along the path pulse
      erratically, agitated and wild. Micah doesn't notice the warning, already planning his approach.

      "There," the tortoise said, pointing a wrinkled foot toward a shadowed path. "Many
      threads gather in the wild places. But Micah, listen: they will match your energy.
      If you go in rushing, you'll find only chaos. You must..." But Micah was already up,
      already moving. "Got it! Thanks!" He sprinted toward the path, missing the tortoise's
      sad shake of its head. The warning about stillness hadn't sunk in at all.
