    focus: Trying a new approach with difficulty

    visual: |
      Micah stands rigid and completely still beneath the golden threads, fists clenched
      at his sides, body visibly tense with the effort of not moving. Threads hover nearby
      but wobble uncertainly, responding to his internal struggle. His jaw is tight, sweat
      beads on his forehead. The moth from before circles around him, still calm, as if
      waiting for something.

      Micah planted his feet and forced himself to freeze. No running. No jumping. Just...
      still. His muscles twitched with the need to move. His fingers curled into fists.
      "Stay still," he whispered through gritted teeth. The threads drifted closer, but
      they wavered, sensing the tension coiled inside him like a spring. Being motionless
      wasn't the same as being calm.

    focus: Discovering the journey continues deeper

    visual: |
      Micah's rigid stance has collapsed slightly—he's bent forward, hands on his knees,
      breathing raggedly. The threads have pulled back again, flickering. But now a path
      of softly glowing stones appears before him, leading deeper into the forest toward
      a place where the light is gentler. The moth hovers at the path's beginning, wings
      creating a slow, rhythmic pattern. An invitation.

      His legs started bouncing despite his best effort. The stillness broke like a snapped
      rubber band, and Micah gasped, moving again. The threads scattered. "I can't do this!"
      But the moth landed on a stone at his feet, and suddenly he noticed: a path of glowing
      stones leading toward softer light. Not asking him to stop moving, but to move...
      differently. Micah straightened, curious. "Okay. Show me."
