      Elise carefully opens her window, moving slowly so as not to startle the fragile creature.
      The paperbird hovers just out of reach, wings trembling. Up close, Elise can see the
      exquisite detail—it's made of ancient parchment with tiny writing in languages she doesn't
      know. Its colors pulse with emotion: worry (gray-blue), hope (pale gold), fear (fading
      silver). Elise extends one gentle hand. "I see you," she whispers. The paperbird tilts its
      head, then slowly flies toward the Whispering Woods.

      "I see you," Elise whispered, and the paperbird seemed to understand. It flew toward the
      woods, then stopped, looking back. It wanted her to follow. Elise grabbed her sketchbook—
      she had to help.

      Elise stands at the edge of the Whispering Woods where afternoon light creates a golden
      archway between trees. She's dressed simply, carrying her sketchbook clutched to her chest
      like a shield and a comfort. The paperbird waits at the forest's edge, wings still flickering
      worryingly between colors. Elise feels anxious—the woods are big and she's small—but the
      paperbird needs her. She takes a breath, gathering quiet courage, and steps forward. The
      woods seem to welcome her with gentle rustling.

      Elise's heart beat fast as she entered the woods. She was scared, but the paperbird needed
      someone who truly saw it. Maybe that's why it chose her. She walked forward, quiet but brave.
