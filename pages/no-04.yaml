description: Noah encounters the Luminary Fox, who speaks in riddles about the compass pointing to decisions rather than destinations, then guides him toward a dark cave that transforms into crystal beauty.

visual: |
  Noah enters the cave mouth, one hand on the rock wall, the other holding the compass which
  now glows with golden light, illuminating the darkness. The cave interior reveals crystal
  formations that catch and multiply the light—suddenly the scary cave becomes a cathedral
  of beauty. Noah's expression shifts from fear to wonder, mouth open in amazement. Strange,
  beautiful minerals glitter in the walls. The path descends deeper.

  The Luminary Fox appeared like moonlight made solid—glowing, impossible, beautiful. "The
  needle points not to destinations, but to decisions," it said, voice like wind chimes.
  "The compass shows what you need to face, not what you want to find. Follow it anyway."
  The compass pointed at the cave—dark, cold, exactly where Noah didn't want to go. But
  inside, the cave transformed, revealing walls of crystal that sang with light. "Oh," Noah
  laughed despite his fear. "You were showing me this."
