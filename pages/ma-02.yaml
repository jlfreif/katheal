      Maya lands in the magnificent Library of Kathaél. Ancient trees with glowing books on
      branches. Floating scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books flutter playfully past. In the center
      rises the massive crystalline Heart Crystal with five pedestals arranged in a circle. The word
      riddles pedestal glows before her, covered in riddles that shift and change their meaning. Maya
      reads the first riddle quickly, making a snap judgment about its answer. She nearly touches a
      wrong symbol. A book flutters down and stops her. Her expression shows surprised realization—
      her quick surface reading almost led her wrong. The riddles have hidden depths. The atmosphere
      reveals a challenge with layers. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Maya landed in the Library of Kathaél. Books floated like curious birds. Scrolls chimed. The word riddles pedestal glowed before her, covered in shifting text. She read fast, artist's eye making quick judgments. "That one means..." She reached for a symbol. A book swooped down and stopped her. Wrong! The riddle's surface meaning hid something deeper. "Okay, so this place has layers," she said.

      The owl swoops down and lands beside the word riddles pedestal. "The Library holds every story of
      courage ever told," it explains. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People forget how
      to keep trying. How to face their fears. The riddles especially—everyone judges by first glance.
      The deeper meanings are forgotten. Can you help?" Maya thought of stories she'd judged too quickly.
      She looks at the pedestal more carefully now. Each riddle shows two meanings—the obvious surface one
      and a hidden deeper truth beneath. She realizes this whole challenge operates on seeing what's truly
      there beneath the words. Her expression shows determined curiosity. Golden threads appear faintly,
      guiding her deeper into the Library to find the riddle challenges. The Heart Crystal pulses weakly
      in the background. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      A golden owl watched from a branch. "The Library holds every story of courage ever told," it said. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People forget how to keep trying. How to face their fears. The riddles especially—everyone judges by first glance. No one looks deeper anymore. Can you help?" Maya thought of stories she'd judged too quickly. She studied the pedestal again. Each riddle had layers—surface and depth. Both mattered. "I can try," she said. "I can learn to see what's really there." Golden threads appeared, leading deeper into the Library.
