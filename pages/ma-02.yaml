      A vast meadow in Kathaél where everything should be colorful but isn't—flowers faded to
      grey, grass muted to dull green, sky pale and lifeless. Maya stands in the center, turning
      in dismay. Ribbons of color that should flow through the air hang limp and transparent.
      Creatures that should be vibrant sit grey and still. A rainbow that arcs across the sky
      is only three faint colors instead of seven. Maya crouches to touch a grey flower, her
      expression showing concern and determination. The atmosphere feels muted and sad, like the
      world forgot how to be bold.

      Maya stepped into a world drained of color. Everywhere she looked, grey and faded and dim.
      Flowers that should blaze with life sat colorless and drooping. The sky hung pale and tired.
      She touched a grey petal. It felt wrong, like someone had told it to be quieter, smaller,
      less itself. This world had forgotten how to be bold. How to be authentic. How to shine.

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Maya stands before a particular section of the faded meadow, pulling out a small travel
      paint set from her pocket. She dips her finger in pink paint and touches a grey flower.
      For a moment, pink blooms where she touched, bright and alive. Then it fades back to grey.
      But the attempt matters—a golden thread appears faintly, responding to her authentic action.
      Her face shows determination and defiance. Around her, the faded world seems to lean in
      hopefully. The atmosphere shifts from observation to action, from sadness to brave purpose.

      Maya pulled out the small paint set she always carried. She touched pink to a grey flower,
      watching color bloom and then fade. But for that second, it had been vibrant and real. A
      golden thread appeared, faint but present. Kathaél was responding to her boldness. "I can
      help you remember," she told the faded meadow. "I'll show you how to be yourself again."
      Even if she didn't know how yet.
