    visual: |
      Maya stands between worlds, her paint-stained fingers touching a shimmering
      portal where her painting transformed into a doorway. Through it, she sees
      a meadow with frozen dancers—shadow figures stuck mid-leap, mid-spin,
      unable to complete their movements. Golden threads connect them but flicker
      weakly. Her athletic build is poised on tiptoes, ready to leap through.

      When Maya touched the glowing dancer, the painting opened like a door.
      Through it she saw a meadow filled with frozen performances—dancers
      stuck mid-leap, musicians silent with instruments raised, performers
      captured in moments that should have flowed into the next. Golden threads
      connected them all, flickering like candles about to die. Something was
      very wrong.

    focus: Decision to act

    visual: |
      Maya steps fully into Kathaél, standing in the meadow of frozen performances.
      Her Madrid bedroom fades to translucent behind her. She spins once,
      testing the space, and frozen dancers seem to lean toward her motion.
      Golden threads from the Heart Crystal drift closer. Her expression shows
      bold determination mixed with excited curiosity.

    text: |
      Maya stepped through, and her bedroom dissolved like watercolor in rain.
      The meadow surrounded her, silent where it should have been full of music
      and movement. She spun experimentally, and the frozen dancers seemed to
      sway toward her, yearning. "You need someone to help you finish," Maya
      understood. She grinned, bold and ready. "Perfect. I love a challenge."
