      Maya lands in the magnificent Library of Kathaél. Ancient trees with glowing books on
      branches. Floating scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books flutter playfully past. In the center
      rises the massive crystalline Heart Crystal with five pedestals arranged in a circle. The Living
      Canvas pedestal glows before her—blank canvases floating in the air, brushes and paints hovering
      nearby. Maya grabs a brush eagerly and paints a bird in quick, confident strokes. Beautiful! But
      as soon as she finishes, the painted bird flickers like a candle flame and dissolves into smoke.

      Maya landed in the Library of Kathaél. Books floated like curious birds. Scrolls chimed. The Living Canvas pedestal glowed before her, blank canvases waiting. Maya grabbed a brush and painted fast—a bird in flight. Done! But the bird flickered and dissolved like smoke. Gone. Her painting hadn't held. "What?" she said. "It was good. It was fast."

      The owl swoops down and lands beside the Living Canvas pedestal. "The Library holds every story of
      courage ever told," it explains. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People forget how
      to keep trying. How to face their fears. The paintings especially—people rush them now. Quick art
      that dissolves before it can truly live. Can you help?" Maya looks around and sees faded paintings
      on the Library walls—ghosts of art that used to be alive and moving but now are just shadows. She
      realizes these canvases need something more than speed. Her expression shows determined curiosity.
      Golden threads appear faintly, guiding her deeper into the Library to find the canvas challenges.

      A golden owl watched from a branch. "The Heart Crystal is energized by acts of courage, writing them as stories into the Library's books. These stories give people on Earth the strength to keep being brave. If the Crystal fails completely, the stories stop flowing—and courage itself begins to die everywhere. Can you help?" Maya saw faded paintings on the walls—ghosts of what used to be alive. She looked at the blank canvases. "I can try," she said. "I can learn what makes art really live." Golden threads appeared, leading deeper into the Library.
