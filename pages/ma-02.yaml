      Maya stands in a strange forest clearing in Kathaél where everything looks one way on
      first glance but reveals something different when examined closer. A "beautiful" flower
      that's actually wilting inside. A "scary" creature with fierce teeth that's actually crying.
      A "clear" path that leads to a cliff. Maya moves forward confidently, reading the scene
      with her artist's eye the way she always does. She nearly steps off the cliff, catches
      herself at the last second. Her expression shows surprised realization—her usual skills
      work differently here. The atmosphere reveals a world with hidden layers.

      Maya landed in a forest that glowed with color. She walked fast, reading it like she always did—artist's eye, quick and confident. That flower looked beautiful. That path looked clear. That cliff looked far aw— She skidded to a stop, toes at the edge. "Okay, so that was ALMOST a really bad first impression," she said. This place had different rules.

      Maya steps back from the cliff carefully, now looking more closely. A golden owl perches
      nearby, watching her with knowing eyes. "The forest needs someone who can see what's really
      there," it says. Maya notices now that the "beautiful" flower was dying, the "scary" creature
      needed help, the "simple" trees hold complex root systems visible beneath translucent bark.
      She realizes this whole world operates on hidden truths beneath surface appearances. Her
      expression shows determined curiosity. A golden thread appears, faint but guiding.

      A golden owl watched from a branch. "In Kathaél, surfaces often hide the truth. The forest is fading because no one looks deeper anymore. Everyone judges by first glance. Can you help?" Maya looked around with new eyes. That dying flower needed help. That scared creature needed a friend. "I can try," she said. "I can learn to see."
