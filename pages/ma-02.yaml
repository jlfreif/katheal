      A vast meadow in Kathaél where everything should be colorful but isn't—flowers faded to
      grey, grass muted to dull green, sky pale and lifeless. Maya stands in the center, turning
      in dismay. Ribbons of color that should flow through the air hang limp and transparent.
      Creatures that should be vibrant sit grey and still. A rainbow that arcs across the sky
      is only three faint colors instead of seven. Maya crouches to touch a grey flower, her
      expression showing concern and determination. The atmosphere feels muted and sad, like the
      world forgot how to be bold.

      The paint pulled Maya through her window into a world without color. Grey flowers, grey grass, pale empty sky. She touched a grey petal. It felt wrong, like someone had told it to whisper when it wanted to shout.

    visual: |
      Maya stands before a particular section of the faded meadow, pulling out a small travel
      paint set from her pocket. She dips her finger in pink paint and touches a grey flower.
      For a moment, pink blooms where she touched, bright and alive. Then it fades back to grey.
      But the attempt matters—a golden thread appears faintly, responding to her authentic action.
      Her face shows determination and defiance. Around her, the faded world seems to lean in
      hopefully. The atmosphere shifts from observation to action, from sadness to brave purpose.

      Maya pulled out her paint set and touched pink to a grey flower. For one second, color bloomed bright and real. Then faded back to grey. But a golden thread appeared, faint but present. "I can help you remember," Maya told the faded world.
