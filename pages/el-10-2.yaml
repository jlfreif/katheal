      The restored paperbird flies circles around Elise, trailing starlight and color. Then it
      lands gently on her open sketchbook, and where its wings touch the paper, words appear—
      written in Elise's own handwriting but more confident, more sure. The words describe
      everything she's seen and never said: the beauty in small things, the power of gentle
      presence, the importance of noticing. The paperbird has given her a gift: the ability to
      see her own voice as powerful.

      The paperbird touched her sketchbook and words appeared—her words, her observations, her
      truths. "You gave me voice," the paperbird seemed to say. "Now accept your own." Elise read
      the words and finally saw herself clearly.

      The paperbird and Elise sit together in the garden as the Garden of Whispers blooms into
      full glory around them—every flower showing images of truth spoken, quiet courage honored,
      gentle power recognized. Other paperbirds gather, all vibrant and healthy, singing in
      harmony. The Weaver of Words appears at the garden's edge, its many eyes gleaming with
      approval. Elise holds the restored paperbird gently, understanding now: she didn't just
      save it. She discovered her own voice in the process.

      The garden celebrated—flowers blooming in waves of color, paperbirds singing in crystal
      harmonies. Elise smiled, tears on her cheeks, her paperbird glowing in her hands. She'd
      found her voice. And it had always been enough.
