      Elise walks back through the woods toward the Garden of Whispers as twilight deepens. But
      she moves differently now—with quiet confidence, shoulders back, cradling the paperbird
      gently. Sky-moths follow her like an escort, their light creating a soft glow around her
      path. The woods seem to recognize her transformation—flowers bloom as she passes, trees
      lean close as if listening. The paperbird, sensing her change, manages a small flutter of
      hope. Its colors pulse faintly: gray-gold becoming more gold than gray.

      Elise walked back to the garden with new purpose. She wasn't different—she was just finally
      seeing herself clearly. Her quiet voice had always mattered. Now she just needed to use it.

      Elise arrives at the Garden of Whispers as stars begin to appear overhead. The garden seems
      to have been waiting—flowers all turned toward the center pool, expectant. The paperbird
      hovers weakly above the water, its fading form reflected in the still surface. Elise kneels
      at the pool's edge, takes a deep breath, and looks at the paperbird with clear, gentle eyes.
      She knows what to say now. She knows her voice matters. The garden holds its breath in
      anticipation.

      The garden waited. The paperbird waited. Elise took a breath, looked at the fragile creature
      she'd been trying to save, and finally understood: the paperbird's story was her story. And
      she was ready to speak it.
