      Noah sits in the grove of tangled stories, posture changed. His notebook
      lies closed on the ground. His hands rest open in his lap, palms up, empty.
      His expression shows surrender that is also peace. The tangled threads
      around him wait, still faintly glowing.

      Noah set his notebook down, gently, like releasing something precious.
      "I can't force endings onto stories that aren't mine." His hands opened,
      empty. No pen. No plan. Just honesty. The fox from earlier had been right.
      The stories knew their own endings. They just needed someone brave enough
      to let them find their way.

    visual: |
      Golden threads shimmer into visibility around Noah, pulsing with soft
      light connecting him to something beyond the grove. His eyes widen with
      wonder. The tangled story-threads begin to unknot, slowly writing
      themselves. Warmth suffuses the scene like sunrise.

      Golden light shimmered through the air. Noah gasped as warmth flooded
      through him, like someone far away was being brave at the same moment he
      was. The girl at the crossroads? The threads around him trembled, then
      began writing themselves, words blooming like flowers. "We're doing this
      together," he whispered. "Even if we can't see each other."
