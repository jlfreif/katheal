      Noah stands at a makeshift planning board (a floating scroll). He's drawn diagrams showing the timing
      for each pedestal. "On my count," he says, reviewing his notes. "Constellation at one. Word riddle at
      two. Math at three. Music at four. Mechanism at five. Then all together on six." He raises his hand.
      "Ready? One... two..." He sprints to the first pedestal. It fails. The pedestals flash red. "Again!"
      Noah calls. He resets and runs through the sequence. Second attempt. Third. The countdown ticks lower.
      Noah's expression shows focused determination. Keep trying. The atmosphere is solo persistence through

The pedestals flashed red. "Again!" Second attempt. Wrong timing. Third. Fourth. The countdown ticked lower. But he kept trying. Learning from each attempt.

      how I stay in sync!" The golden thread glows brighter. He found the missing piece. His expression shows

      "Wait!" Noah shouted. "I'm counting in my head! But look—" A golden thread connected all five pedestals through the Heart Crystal. "Feel the rhythm through the crystal!" He placed his hand on the pedestal. The crystal pulsed. Once. Twice. A heartbeat he could feel. A rhythm to follow. "There!" Noah grinned. "Now I'm connected. Let's try again. With the crystal's rhythm."
