    visual: |
      Noah sits in the grove of tangled stories, but his posture has changed.
      His notebook lies closed on the ground beside him. His hands rest open
      in his lap, palms up, empty of pen. His expression shows surrender that
      is also peace. Around him, frozen story-threads wait.

      Noah set his notebook down. Not put it away—set it down, gently, like
      releasing something precious. His hands opened, empty. No pen. No plan.
      Just trust. The stories had known their endings all along. They didn't
      need him to write them. They needed him to believe they could.

    focus: Feeling the connection

    visual: |
      Golden threads shimmer into visibility around Noah, pulsing with soft
      light that seems to connect him to something beyond the grove. His eyes
      widen with wonder. The story-threads near him begin to tremble, then
      slowly start writing themselves. Warmth suffuses the scene.

      Golden light shimmered through the air, threads appearing from nowhere,
      connecting everything. Noah felt warmth flood through him—like someone,
      somewhere, was believing alongside him. The frozen stories trembled.
      Then, one by one, they began to write themselves. He wasn't alone in
      this.
