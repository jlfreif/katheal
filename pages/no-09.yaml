    visual: |
      Noah runs full speed through the forest library toward the Heart Crystal's chamber. Shadow creatures
      made of failed stories block his path. He dodges left, rolls under a grasping tendril of darkness,
      springs back to his feet. Uses his climbing skills to scale a massive fallen bookshelf. A shadow
      creature lunges—he kicks off the shelf, flips over it. His athletic training from basketball and urban
      exploration serves him well. More creatures ahead. He analyzes the pattern in their movements while running.
      Spots an opening. Dives through. Gets knocked down. Struggles up. Keeps going. His expression shows
      fierce determination mixed with exhaustion. This is the hardest fight he's ever faced. The atmosphere
      is intense physical action and unwavering persistence.

      Noah sprinted toward the Heart Crystal. Shadow creatures blocked the path. He didn't stop. Dodged. Rolled. Jumped. Got knocked down. Got back up. Kept running. His first approach failed—shadows too thick. He tried another route. Failed again. Third attempt—almost through, then slammed back. He lay gasping. Every muscle screaming. He could give up. Go home. But he pushed to his feet. "One more try," he panted. "And another after that. However many it takes." He charged forward again.

    focus: Breaking through at last
    visual: |
      Noah breaks through the final shadow barrier and reaches the Heart Crystal's chamber. He's battered,
      exhausted, covered in dust and glowing residue from shadow creatures. But he made it. The Heart Crystal
      pulses before him, responding to his persistence. He touches it and warmth floods through. His determination—
      trying again and again despite failure—awakened something. The Crystal blazes with light. All through the
      library, stories pulse with warmth—someone far away is also persisting through their own struggle.
      Noah feels the connection. He grins through his exhaustion. Getting it right the first time wasn't courage.
      Trying again after failing was. His expression shows triumphant relief. The atmosphere celebrates
      hard-won victory through persistence.

      Noah burst through. Reached the Crystal. Battered. Exhausted. But he'd made it. Not on the first try. Not the second. Or third. But he hadn't stopped. The Crystal blazed in response. Warmth flooded through him. Somewhere far away, someone else was also refusing to give up. He felt them. "I didn't get it right the first time," Noah breathed, grinning despite his exhaustion. "But I kept trying. That's the real courage."
