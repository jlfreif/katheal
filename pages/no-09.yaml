      Noah stands at a makeshift planning board (a floating scroll). He's drawn diagrams showing the timing
      for each pedestal. His teammates gather around as he explains the sequence. "On my count," he says,
      pointing to each position. "Constellation at one. Word riddle at two. Math at three. Music at four.
      Mechanism at five. Then all together on six." They nod, moving to their positions. Noah raises his hand.
      "Ready? One... two..." They try. It fails. The pedestals flash red. "Again!" Noah calls. They reset.
      Second attempt. Third. The countdown ticks lower. Noah's expression shows focused determination. Keep
      trying. The atmosphere is teamwork through persistence. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font.

The pedestals flashed red. "Again!" Second attempt. Wrong timing. Third. Fourth. The countdown ticked lower. But they kept trying. Learning from each attempt.

      Noah suddenly sees it. When they work together, a golden thread connects all five pedestals through
      the Heart Crystal. But they've been counting separately. "Wait!" he shouts. "We're not listening to each
      other! Feel the rhythm through the crystal!" He places his hand on his pedestal. The others do the same.
      The Heart Crystal pulses once. Twice. Creating a rhythm they can all feel. A beat they can share. Noah's
      eyes light up. "There! That's how we stay in sync!" The golden thread glows brighter. They found the
      missing piece. His expression shows breakthrough understanding. The atmosphere celebrates discovering
      connection. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      "Wait!" Noah shouted. "We're counting separately! But look—" A golden thread connected all five pedestals through the Heart Crystal. "Feel the rhythm through the crystal!" Everyone placed hands on their pedestals. The crystal pulsed. Once. Twice. A heartbeat they could all feel. Sharing the same rhythm. "There!" Noah grinned. "Now we're connected. Let's try again. Together."
