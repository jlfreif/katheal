      Noah stands with his hands hovering over the Heart Crystal's story threads. He could pull
      them. Control it. Make it safe. Every instinct screams to take control. But he remembers the
      free stories he watched—how they found their own truth. How control strangled them. His hands
      are shaking. Tears in his eyes. This is the hardest thing he's ever done. He slowly, agonizingly,
      pulls his hands back. Lets go. The story is free to choose, even if it chooses wrong. His
      expression shows terrified surrender. The atmosphere is the moment of ultimate release.

      Noah's hands hovered. One pull. He could control it. Make it safe. Make it right. But controlling was killing. He thought of all the stories he'd watched die from too much control. Even his own. Especially his own. Tears ran down his face. He pulled his hands back. Let go. "I can't control you," he whispered to the story. "Please. Find your own way."

      The Heart Crystal's story takes the dark path Noah feared. Goes into danger. Makes the hard
      choice. And transforms. The darkness wasn't wrong—it was necessary. The character's choice
      led somewhere Noah's control never could have imagined. More beautiful. More true. The Heart
      Crystal blazes with light. All through the library, stories pulse with warmth—someone far
      away is also letting go. Noah feels the connection. He sobs with relief and awe. Control
      wasn't courage. Trust was. His expression shows overwhelmed gratitude. The atmosphere
      celebrates the wisdom beyond planning.

      The story went into darkness. Noah watched, terrified. Then—transformation. The darkness was the way through. The character's choice was exactly right. Better than safe. Truer than Noah's plans. The Crystal blazed. Warmth flooded through him. Someone far away was letting go at the same moment. He wasn't alone. "I can't control everything," Noah breathed. "And that's not failing. That's trust."
