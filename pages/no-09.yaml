      Noah sits in the forest library. Incomplete stories scattered around him. Pages on tree branches.
      Crossed out attempts crumpled nearby. Evening light filters through leaves. He stares at the
      failures. Takes a deep breath. Sets his jaw. Picks up his pen again. His posture straightens.
      From defeated to resolved. The atmosphere is quiet. Introspective. A moment of internal decision.

      Noah looked at the failures. Every crossed-out page a reminder. He hadn't gotten it right yet. He could stop. No one would blame him. But stopping meant giving up. He thought about the stories he loved. Their heroes kept trying. Even when it seemed impossible. "That's the point," he whispered. He picked up his pen.

      Golden threads suddenly shimmer throughout the forest library. Pulsing with warm light. Noah
      stands, looking up in wonder as threads flow around him like aurora borealis. Connecting stories
      in patterns he hadn't seen. One thread pulses particularly bright. Reaching toward something far
      away. He feels warmth in his chest. His expression shifts to amazement. On the page before him,
      words flow easily. The story finding its own path. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space

      The library blazed golden. Threads appeared everywhere. Connecting stories. One pulsed warmly. Reaching toward something distant. Noah felt it in his chest. Like someone far away was choosing the same courage. "I'm not alone," he breathed. The words flowed. Not forced. Invited. The story knew where it wanted to go.
