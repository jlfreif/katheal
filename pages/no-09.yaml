      Noah sits in the grove of tangled stories, posture changed. His notebook
      lies closed on the ground. His hands rest open in his lap, palms up, empty.
      His expression shows surrender that is also peace. The tangled threads
      around him wait, still faintly glowing.

      Noah picked up his notebook from the mud, wiped it gently, and set it on a dry
      stone. Not thrown away. Just... set aside. "I can't decode what these stories need."
      His hands opened, empty. No pen. No analysis. Just honesty. The fox from earlier
      had been right. The stories knew their own endings. They just needed someone brave
      enough to be present without understanding everything.

    visual: |
      Golden threads shimmer into visibility around Noah, pulsing with soft
      light connecting him to something beyond the grove. His eyes widen with
      wonder. The tangled story-threads begin to unknot, slowly writing
      themselves. Warmth suffuses the scene like sunrise.

      Golden light shimmered through the air, warm on his skin. Noah gasped as joy
      flooded through him—not his own joy, but someone else's, someone far away being
      brave at the exact same moment. The girl at the crossroads? The threads around
      him trembled, then began writing themselves, words blooming like flowers. "We're
      doing this together," he whispered. "Even if we can't see each other."
