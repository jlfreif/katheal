description: With Ellie's feather charm as his anchor, Noah returns to the pool with new understanding—realizing the compass never showed him the destination, it showed him his inner compass all along.

visual: |
  Noah stands at the pool's edge, holding the compass with both hands, but no longer needing
  it to tell him what to do. His posture radiates quiet confidence. Around him, the grove
  glows—not magically, but with the light of his own clarity. He pulls out the feather charm,
  holds it and the compass together. They glow in harmony. Behind him, a path appears that he
  hadn't seen before—leading to the final truth. He smiles, ready.

  Noah returned to the pool, but everything had changed—not the grove, but him. He wasn't
  seeking certainty anymore. He was seeking courage to choose anyway. This time, Noah looked
  his fears in the eye. "You're not wrong choices," he whispered. "You're how I learned what
  mattered." The pool showed him a revelation: every path he'd walked had built something inside
  him. The compass never pointed to places. It pointed to who he needed to become. Noah laughed—
  surprised and relieved and joyful all at once. "You were showing me my own courage."
