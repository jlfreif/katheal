      Noah's hands glow as he touches the Heart Crystal chains. "I'm going to let you go," he
      whispers to the story inside. "You can try. You can fail. You can risk it." He pulls at the
      chains—they resist, thick and strong. He pulls harder. The chains loosen. The story inside
      surges forward, trying its risky move—and immediately stumbles. Makes a mistake. Noah's hands
      shoot out instinctively, catching the story, trying to guide it— "No!" He jerks back. He failed.
      He grabbed control again. The chains tighten. He messed up. His heart pounds. Try again. He
      releases his grip. The story tries again—fails again. Noah's hands twitch but he keeps them
      back. The story tries a third time. Fourth. Each attempt different. Some spectacular failures.
      Noah grits his teeth, sweat dripping, fighting every instinct. He slips up twice more—grabbing
      control reflexively—has to force himself to let go again. His expression shows agonized
      determination through repeated failure. The atmosphere is courage through imperfection. Text in
      Times New Roman 16pt font.

      Noah touched the Heart Crystal chains. "You can try," he whispered. "You can fail." He pulled. Chains loosened. The story tried its risky move—stumbled. Failed. Noah's hands shot out, catching it, guiding— "NO!" He jerked back. He'd failed. Grabbed control again. The chains tightened. Try again. Let go. Let go. The story tried again. Failed again. Noah's hands twitched. Stay back. Let it fail. Third attempt. Fourth. Noah slipped—grabbed control—had to release again. He was failing at letting go. But he kept trying. That was the point.

      The Heart Crystal story tries one more time—and something clicks. Not perfect. Not flawless.
      But earned through all those messy attempts. The story blazes brilliant gold, fully alive. The
      chains shatter completely. Energy explodes outward from the Heart Crystal, washing through all
      of Kathaél. Every chained story in the library suddenly breaks free—all at once—spiraling into
      the air in joyous, messy, imperfect life. Stories trying things, making mistakes, learning,
      living. Noah collapses to his knees, exhausted, hands shaking. He failed at letting go
      perfectly—grabbed control multiple times, had to release again and again. But he kept trying.
      Kept choosing courage after each mistake. The owl lands beside him. "You learned it too, not
      just your stories. Courage isn't getting it right the first time. It's trying again after you
      fail." Noah feels a pulse from the Heart Crystal—connecting to someone far away, also learning
      to try again. His expression shows exhausted relief and transformation. The atmosphere
      celebrates earned wisdom through failure. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The Heart Crystal story tried again. And again. Seventh attempt—something clicked. Not perfect. Earned. The story blazed gold. Chains shattered. Energy exploded through Kathaél—every story breaking free at once. Spiraling, trying, failing, living. Noah collapsed, shaking. He'd failed at letting go perfectly—grabbed control back three times. But he kept releasing. Kept trying. That was courage. The owl smiled. "You learned it too. Courage is trying again after mistakes." The Heart Crystal pulsed, connecting to someone far away also learning to persist. Noah grinned weakly. "Yeah. I get it now."
