    visual: |
      The Heart Crystal rises in a vast clearing. Massive. Tall as a building. Six facets, each a
      different color. All cracked. Dimming. Dark energy pulses from the cracks like black lightning.
      Golden threads hang limp and grey. Six children arrive from different paths. Elise (9, long brown
      hair, graceful). Maya (9, wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond hair with pink streak, bold). Micah (9, black hair, athletic). Mona (2,
      tiny, curious). Max (12, red hair parted, tall). Noah (12, sandy blond voluminous hair, determined). They see
      each other. Eyes widen in recognition and surprise. Family. Together in Kathaél. The crystal's
      cracks pulse with darkness. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Six paths led to one place. Noah stepped into the clearing. Stopped. "Elise? Maya? Micah? Max? Mona?" His family stood before an enormous cracked crystal. Maya's eyes went wide. "Noah! We're all here!" They stared at each other. Then at the dying crystal. Dark lightning crackled from its cracks. "Together then," Noah said.

    focus: Heart Crystal fights back with resistance
    visual: |
      Each child reaches toward a facet. Elise at the blue facet. Maya at the pink facet. Micah at
      the green facet. Mona's tiny hands at the orange facet. Max at the red facet. Noah at the yellow
      facet. They touch simultaneously. The crystal EXPLODES with dark energy. Black lightning blasts
      outward. The children hold on but get thrown back slightly. The cracks widen. Pulse darker. The
      crystal resists violently. Shadows swirl. The children struggle to hold their ground. Their faces
      show determination mixed with shock. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      "Each facet different," Elise said. "Like us." They moved to their facets. "On three," Max said. "One. Two..." "Three!" Micah shouted. Six hands touched. The crystal EXPLODED. Dark lightning. Blasting outward. Throwing them back. The cracks widened. Pulsed darker. The crystal fought them.
