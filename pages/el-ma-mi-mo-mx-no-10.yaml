    visual: |
      The Heart Crystal rises in a vast clearing. Massive. Tall as a building. Six facets, each a
      different color (blue, pink, green, orange, red, yellow). All cracked. Dimming. Dark energy
      pulses from the cracks. Golden threads pull six children from different paths into the
      clearing. Elise (9, Caucasian with fair skin, long brown hair, graceful). Maya (9, Caucasian with fair skin, wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond
      hair with pink streak, bold). Micah (9, half-Japanese half-Caucasian, black hair, athletic). Mona (2, Caucasian with fair skin, tiny, curious). Max
      (12, Caucasian with fair skin, red hair parted down the middle, tall). Noah (12, Caucasian with fair skin, sandy blond voluminous hair,
      determined). They see each other. Eyes widen in shock and recognition. "What are YOU doing
      here?" Family. Together in Kathaél. The Heart Crystal cracks louder. Text in Times New Roman
      16pt in white space at bottom.

      Golden threads pulled six children to the Library's heart. The Heart Crystal rose before them. Massive. Cracked. Dimming. The Library dying with it. They saw each other. Froze. "Max?!" "Elise?!" "Noah?!" Family. All of them. Here. "What are YOU doing here?" Maya asked. The crystal cracked louder. Dark energy pulsed. Fighting back. "Together," Noah said. "We save the Library together."

    focus: Using powers together, crystal fights back
    visual: |
      Each child reaches toward their facet. Elise at the blue facet. Maya at the pink facet.
      Micah at the green facet. Mona's tiny hands at the orange facet. Max at the red facet
      (showing complex obstacle patterns etched in light). Noah at the yellow facet. Max sees his
      facet activate - obstacles appearing in the air that he'll have to complete while maintaining
      contact with the crystal. All six touch simultaneously. The crystal pulses with energy - not
      blasting them back yet, but clearly powerful and complex. They're beginning their individual
      challenges. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Six facets. Six colors. Blue. Pink. Green. Orange. Red. Yellow. Each child moved to theirs. "On three," Max called. "One... two... THREE!" Six hands. Six facets. All activated. Musical patterns for Elise. Paint strokes for Maya. Movement for Micah. Curiosity for Mona. Obstacles for Max. Stories for Noah. Each challenge connected to the Library. They moved. Each using their courage.
