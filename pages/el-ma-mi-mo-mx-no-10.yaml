      The Heart Crystal rises in a vast clearing. Massive. Tall as a building. Six facets, each a
      different color. All cracked. Dimming. Golden threads hang limp and grey. Six children arrive
      from different paths. Elise (9, long brown hair, graceful). Maya (9, pink-streaked hair, bold).
      Micah (9, black hair, athletic). Mona (2, tiny, curious). Max (12, red hair parted, tall). Noah
      (12, sandy blond, determined). They see each other. Eyes widen in recognition and surprise. Family.
      Together in Kathaél. The crystal's cracks pulse with darkness. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in
      white space at bottom.

      Six paths led to one place. Noah stepped into the clearing. Stopped. "Elise? Maya? Micah? Max? Mona?" His family stood before an enormous cracked crystal. Maya's eyes went wide. "Noah! We're all here!" They stared at each other. Then at the dying crystal. "Together then," Noah said.

    focus: Taking decisive action
    visual: |
      Each child stands at a facet. Hands raised. Elise at the blue facet humming with music. Maya
      at the pink facet pulsing with color. Micah at the green facet vibrating with movement. Mona's
      tiny hands at the orange facet glowing with wonder. Max at the red facet sparking with ideas.
      Noah at the yellow facet shimmering with stories. All six touch simultaneously. Light explodes.
      Brilliant. Golden threads shoot into the sky. Cracks seal. Colors blaze. The children silhouetted
      in radiant glow. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      "Each facet different," Elise said. "Like us." They moved to their facets. "On three," Max said. "One. Two..." "Three!" Micah shouted. Six hands. Six facets. Light exploded. Through the crystal. Through the threads. Through all of Kathaél. The crystal blazed whole.
