    visual: |
      The Heart Crystal rises in the center of a vast clearing, a massive structure tall as a
      building with six distinct facets, each a different color but all cracked and dimming.
      Golden threads that should flow from it hang limp and grey. Six children stand at the
      clearing's edge: Elise (9, long brown hair, graceful), Maya (9, pink-streaked hair, bold),
      Micah (9, black hair, athletic), Mona (2, tiny, curious), Max (12, red hair parted down
      middle, tall), and Noah (12, sandy blond, determined). They've arrived from different
      paths, seeing each other and the massive crystal for the first time. The crystal's cracks
      pulse with darkness. The atmosphere is tense and momentous. This is the heart of everything.

      Six paths. One place. Maya, Elise, Micah, Mona, Max, and Noah stood at the clearing's edge. The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracked and fading. "Together," Noah said. "All of us." They stepped forward as one.

    focus: Taking decisive action
    visual: |
      Each child stands before a facet of the Heart Crystal, hands raised to touch it. Elise
      reaches for the graceful blue facet that hums with music. Maya touches the bold pink facet
      that pulses with color. Micah connects with the active green facet vibrating with movement.
      Mona's tiny hands press against the curious orange facet glowing with wonder. Max reaches
      for the analytical red facet sparking with ideas. Noah places his palm on the persistent
      yellow facet shimmering with stories. All six touch simultaneously. Brilliant light explodes
      from the crystal, threads of gold shooting into the sky, cracks sealing, colors blazing back
      to life. The children are silhouetted in the radiant glow.

      "Each facet is different," Elise whispered. "Like each of us." "On three," Max said. "One, two..." "Three!" shouted Mona. Six hands. Six facets. Light exploded through the crystal, through the threads, through all of Kathaél. The crystal blazed whole.
