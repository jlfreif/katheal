      The Heart Crystal rises in a vast clearing. Massive. Tall as a building. Six facets, each a
      different color (blue, pink, green, orange, red, yellow). All cracked. Dimming. Dark energy
      pulses from the cracks. Golden threads pull six children from different paths into the
      clearing. Elise (9, long brown hair, graceful). Maya (9, wavy shoulder-length sandy-blond
      hair with pink streak, bold). Micah (9, black hair, athletic). Mona (2, tiny, curious). Max
      (12, red hair parted down the middle, tall). Noah (12, sandy blond voluminous hair,
      determined). They see each other. Eyes widen in shock and recognition. "What are YOU doing
      here?" Family. Together in Kathaél. The Heart Crystal cracks louder. Text in Times New Roman
      16pt in white space at bottom.

      Threads pulled Max toward the Heart Crystal's base. Five other kids stood there, all looking shocked. "Noah? Elise?!" Max's sister Elise stared. "Max?!" Maya, Micah, and Mona arrived from other paths. They were all here. All family. "What are you ALL doing here?" The Heart Crystal cracked louder, light stuttering. A massive pulse of energy pushed back against them. The crystal was fighting them. "Together," Noah said. "We do this together."

      Each child reaches toward their facet. Elise at the blue facet. Maya at the pink facet.
      Micah at the green facet. Mona's tiny hands at the orange facet. Max at the red facet
      (showing complex obstacle patterns etched in light). Noah at the yellow facet. Max sees his
      facet activate - obstacles appearing in the air that he'll have to complete while maintaining
      contact with the crystal. All six touch simultaneously. The crystal pulses with energy - not
      blasting them back yet, but clearly powerful and complex. They're beginning their individual
      challenges. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      "Each facet is different," Elise whispered, touching the crystal. Max saw his facet—a complex pattern of obstacles etched in light. His challenge. "On three," he said, falling into leader mode. "One... two... THREE!" Six hands touched six facets. Max's facet activated, obstacles appearing in the air. He had to complete them all while holding contact with the crystal. He moved, adjusted, persisted. Around him, his cousins did the same.
