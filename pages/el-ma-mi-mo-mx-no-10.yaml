    visual: |
      The Heart Crystal rises like a building before six children gathered in a circle at
      its base. The massive crystalline structure shows deep fractures, each crack glowing
      with escaping golden light. Noah (12, sandy blond hair), Max (12, red hair, tall),
      and Micah (9, black hair, athletic) stand on one side. Elise (9, long brown hair,
      graceful), Maya (9, sandy-blond with pink streak, bold stance), and little Mona (2,
      dark curly hair, bright-eyed) stand on the other. Each child reaches toward a different
      facet of the Crystal, hesitation visible in their postures. The forest clearing pulses
      with dimming light.

    text: |
      The Heart Crystal towered above them, cracks spreading like lightning across its
      surface. Golden light leaked from every fracture, stories dissolving into nothing.
      Noah glanced at the others. Max nodded. Maya took a breath. Elise stepped closer.
      Micah steadied himself. Even little Mona reached up with both hands, determined.

    focus: Taking decisive action - the moment of convergence

    visual: |
      All six children press their hands against the Crystal simultaneously. Each facet
      they touch glows brilliant gold, and streams of light spiral upward from their palms
      into the structure. The cracks begin to seal, golden threads weaving through them
      like stitches. The children's faces show fierce concentration and wonder. Light
      radiates from the Crystal's core, growing brighter and more stable. The whole clearing
      illuminates with warm, pulsing radiance as the Crystal hums with restored power.

    text: |
      "Now," Noah called. Six hands touched six facets at once. The Crystal blazed warm
      beneath their palms, humming like a struck bell. Light surged through the cracks,
      knitting them closed. "Don't let go," Max shouted over the rising sound. The
      threads poured from their courage, weaving into the Crystal. Mona laughed, pure and
      bright. The Heart Crystal sang, whole again.
