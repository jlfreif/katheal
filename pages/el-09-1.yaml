      Elise sits alone after Noah has left the cliff, sky-moths dancing around her in the evening
      light. She's making another small charm from sky-moth wings and grass—her hands know this
      work by heart. As she weaves, she thinks about Noah's grateful face when she gave him the
      first charm. Her quiet words had helped him. The sky-moths seem to glow brighter near her
      gentle presence. The fading paperbird rests in her lap, barely visible now, but watching her
      work with what seems like patience.

      As Elise wove the charm, she remembered: her quiet words had calmed Noah. Her gentle gifts
      had mattered. The sky-moths glowed brighter near her hands. Maybe her voice didn't need to be
      loud to be powerful.

      A realization washes over Elise's face—sudden understanding lighting her eyes. She looks at
      her hands, at the charms she creates, at her sketchbook full of carefully observed beauty,
      at the paperbird who chose her. She's been speaking all along—through her art, her crafts,
      her attention, her gentleness. But the paperbird needs one more thing: her voice speaking
      aloud the truth she's always known but never said. Not shouting. Just true. She stands,
      holding the paperbird carefully, and looks toward the garden with new determination.

      Elise understood now: her voice had always had power—in her art, her gifts, her careful
      noticing. She didn't need to be loud. She just needed to be true. The paperbird needed to hear
      her speak what she'd always known.
