      A massive forest library where ancient trees serve as living shelves, their branches holding
      glowing books and scrolls. But everything is wrong—the ground shakes periodically, cracks
      spread through stone archways, and shimmering barriers flicker and spark dangerously. Noah
      stands at the entrance, eyes wide. Behind crackling energy barriers, he can see stories
      trapped—books pressing against the shields, pages rustling desperately. The barriers pulse
      and fracture, degrading with each tremor. Above each barrier floats an intricate puzzle-lock
      mechanism—gears, symbols, and moving pieces that shift and reconfigure. Some are already
      half-broken. The atmosphere is urgent danger—a race against time. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      Noah stumbled into the forest library just as the ground shook. Crack! A stone pillar split. Books rattled on their branches. Ahead, shimmering barriers trapped hundreds of stories—pressing against the energy fields, pages fluttering like trapped birds. Above each barrier, a puzzle-lock mechanism clicked and whirred, but they were breaking down. Another tremor. A lock shattered completely, and the barrier collapsed—the stories inside scattered into ash. "No!" Noah shouted. He had to solve the locks before they all failed.

    visual: |
      Noah runs to the nearest barrier—about twenty feet high, crackling with unstable energy. The
      puzzle-lock above it is a complex mechanism of rotating rings covered in symbols, sliding
      panels with constellation patterns, and pressure plates that need to be activated in sequence.
      It's easily the hardest puzzle he's ever seen. And it's degrading—sparks fly from damaged
      gears, some symbols are already illegible, parts are seized up. Behind the barrier, a cluster
      of adventure stories pulse with desperate urgency. Noah pulls out his notebook and starts
      analyzing the mechanism, sketching quick diagrams. His expression shows excitement mixed with
      determination. This is exactly the kind of challenge he lives for. The atmosphere is the moment
      before diving into action. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah skidded to a stop at the first barrier. The puzzle-lock above it was massive—rotating rings, sliding symbols, pressure sensors, all interconnected. Beautiful. Complex. And breaking apart. He could see at least three different systems that needed to work together. The ground shook again. More cracks. He had minutes, maybe. Noah grinned despite the danger. "Okay. Let's figure this out." He started mapping the pattern.
