      Noah lands in a magnificent forest library. Ancient trees with glowing books on branches. Floating
      scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books flutter playfully past. In the center rises a massive crystalline
      structure with five pedestals arranged in a circle. Each pedestal shows a different puzzle type glowing
      and waiting. Constellation patterns. Word riddles. Mathematical sequences. Musical notes. Physical
      mechanisms. An owl swoops down, landing on one pedestal. The whole library hums with anticipation.
      The atmosphere is wonder meeting challenge. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah crashed through gold and landed in a forest library. Books floated like curious birds. Scrolls chimed. An owl swooped down. "Welcome, Solver! You answered the call!" It gestured toward five pedestals surrounding a huge crystal. Each pedestal glowed with a different puzzle. Noah's eyes went wide. This was incredible.

      Noah approaches the first pedestal. Constellation patterns float in the air above it, waiting to be
      arranged. Behind the pedestal, the massive Heart Crystal rises, currently dim and inactive. The owl
      explains that all five patterns connect to challenges throughout the library. Noah studies the constellation
      puzzle, his analytical brain already working. He touches a floating star and it glows brighter. Click.
      The first piece slots into place. His expression shows excitement and determination. This is exactly
      the kind of challenge he loves. The atmosphere celebrates discovery and adventure beginning. Text in
      Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      "The Library holds every story of courage ever told," the owl said. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People forget how to keep trying. How to face their fears." Noah thought of his favorite books. What they'd taught him. "We have to fix this." He ran to the first pedestal. Constellation patterns! Stars floated, waiting to be arranged. "If that's the Bear, then the Hunter goes... there!" Click. The pattern glowed. "Yes!" The owl nodded. "But challenges await. Each pedestal connects to trials throughout the library." Noah grinned. "Bring it on."
