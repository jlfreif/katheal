      A magical forest library where ancient trees serve as living shelves, their branches holding
      floating books and scrolls. But many are withering—strangled by golden chains, bound too
      tightly by outlines and rules. Noah stands in the center, shocked. Books struggle against
      their chains. Stories try to breathe but can't. Moss covers the ground. A sign reads:
      "Controlled to death." Scripts hang from branches with every word dictated, but they're grey
      and lifeless. The atmosphere is suffocating control killing creativity. Text in Times New
      Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The golden thread yanked Noah through his window into a forest library. But the stories were dying. Chained. Strangled by outlines too tight. Controlled so much they couldn't breathe. A book fell at his feet, every page filled but every word dead. Planned to death.

    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside one story that's still fighting—a tale about a girl finding her way home.
      It's partially chained but struggling to break free. He can see the writer's notes all over
      it: "She must turn left here." "She must meet the fox at 3pm." "She must say exactly this."
      The story gasps under the weight of control. Noah reaches for the chains, uncertain. His
      instinct is to plan how to help, make a system for saving it. But the story pulses—please,
      just let me go. His expression shows internal conflict. The atmosphere is the moment of
      choice. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      One story still fought. A girl trying to find her way home. But chains covered it. "She must do this. She must say that. She must go here." All controlled. The story gasped. Noah reached for it. His mind immediately started planning: "First I'll analyze the chains, then create a system for removal, then—" The story pulsed weakly. Please. Just let me go.
