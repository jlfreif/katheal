description: Noah decides to trust the compass and steps into the Whispering Woods, but when he reaches a glowing grove, the path disappears and the compass spins wildly at a three-way fork.

visual: |
  Beyond an ancient stone marker covered in swirling symbols, three distinct paths branch
  out—each disappearing into different parts of the forest. The left path climbs upward
  toward rocky cliffs shrouded in mist. The middle path descends into a hollow filled with
  glowing mushrooms and strange sounds. The right path winds through a thicket of thorny
  vines with beautiful silver flowers. Noah stands frozen, compass in hand, but the needle
  spins wildly, unable to choose. His expression shows panic—which way is right?

  Noah took a deep breath and stepped into the Whispering Woods. The woods weren't scary—
  they were alive with wonder, paperbirds singing in crystalline voices, trees whispering
  secrets he couldn't quite understand yet. The compass led him to a glowing grove marked
  by ancient stone—symbols lit up, matching the engravings on his compass perfectly. But
  beyond it: three paths, three choices. And the compass—his one guide—spun uselessly in
  circles. "Just pick one for me!" he whispered. But the compass gave no answer.
