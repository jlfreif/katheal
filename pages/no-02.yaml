      A magical forest library where ancient trees serve as living shelves, their branches holding
      floating books and scrolls. But many are withering—strangled by golden chains, bound too
      tightly by outlines and rules. Noah stands in the center, shocked. Books struggle against
      their chains. Stories try to breathe but can't. Moss covers the ground. A sign reads:
      "Controlled to death." Scripts hang from branches with every word dictated, but they're grey
      and lifeless. The atmosphere is suffocating control killing creativity. Text in Times New

      The golden thread yanked Noah through his window into a forest library. But the stories were dying—gasping, choking. Chains cut into their spines. Pages curled and blackened. A book fell at his feet, cracking apart. Every page filled. Every word perfect. Every sentence exactly where it should be. All dead. Grey ash inside. He opened another. The words crawled with "MUST DO THIS" and "CANNOT DO THAT" scrawled over every line in angry red. The story underneath had suffocated. Planned to death. Controlled to death.

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside one story that's still fighting—a tale about a girl finding her way home.
      It's partially chained but struggling to break free. He can see the writer's notes all over
      it: "She must turn left here." "She must meet the fox at 3pm." "She must say exactly this."
      The story gasps under the weight of control. Noah reaches for the chains, uncertain. His
      instinct is to plan how to help, make a system for saving it. But the story pulses—please,
      just let me go. His expression shows internal conflict. The atmosphere is the moment of
      choice. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      One story still fought—a girl trying to find her way home. Chains wrapped so tight the pages bled. "She MUST turn left here." "She MUST meet the fox at exactly 3pm." "She MUST say these exact words." The girl inside the story was screaming silently, clawing at the pages, trying to break free. The story gasped, dying. Noah reached for it. His mind immediately started planning: "First I'll analyze the chains, map the system, create an optimal removal sequence, then—" The story convulsed. Please. Just let me go.
