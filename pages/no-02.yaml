      Noah stumbles through golden light and lands in the forest library from his story—but it's
      real. Massive ancient trees serve as living shelves, their branches holding glowing books and
      scrolls. Everything he described is here, but intensely real. And wrong. The ground shakes
      violently. Cracks spread through stone archways. Shimmering barriers flicker and spark
      dangerously—exactly like he wrote, but terrifyingly real. Behind the crackling energy barriers,
      he can see stories trapped, pressing desperately against the shields. Above each barrier floats
      the puzzle-lock mechanisms from his sketches—gears, symbols, moving pieces—but they're far
      more intricate than his drawings. Some are already breaking apart. A lock shatters and the
      barrier collapses—stories scatter into ash. Noah stares in horror. This is his story world.
      His creation. The atmosphere is awe mixed with urgent danger. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in

      Noah crashed through light and landed hard. The forest library. His forest library. The one from his story. But real. Solid ground shook beneath him. Stone cracked—BOOM! Books rattled on living branches. Ahead, the energy barriers he'd imagined trapped hundreds of real stories. The puzzle-locks he'd sketched floated above them, but they were far more complex than his drawings. Another tremor. A lock shattered—the stories inside scattered to ash. "No!" This was his world. His creation. And it was falling apart.

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Noah runs to the nearest barrier—about twenty feet high, crackling with unstable energy. The
      puzzle-lock above it is the one from his notebook, but exponentially more complex. He'd drawn
      rotating rings with symbols. The real version has multiple interconnected systems—sliding
      panels with constellation patterns, pressure plates, harmonic sensors, all working together.
      It's degrading—sparks fly, some symbols are illegible, parts are seized. Behind the barrier,
      adventure stories pulse desperately—the kind of stories he loves to write. Noah pulls out his
      notebook, looking at his simple sketches. His story world took his ideas and made them real...
      and much harder. His expression shows excitement mixed with realization—he has to solve the
      actual puzzle, not just describe someone solving it. The atmosphere is accepting the challenge.

      Noah skidded to the first barrier. The puzzle-lock above it—his puzzle-lock from his sketches—was massive. He'd drawn rotating rings and symbols. Simple. The real version had seven interlocking systems, all interconnected. Beautiful. Terrifying. And breaking apart. The ground shook. More cracks. He had minutes. He looked at his notebook sketches. So simple compared to this. "I wrote this world," he muttered. "But I have to actually solve it." He started mapping the real pattern.
