      A magical forest library where ancient trees serve as living shelves, their branches holding
      floating books and scrolls. Golden threads connect stories to tree limbs. Many threads are
      grey and fraying. Noah stands in the center of a clearing, spinning in amazement. Books flicker
      like dying fireflies. Scrolls unravel, words disappearing. Moss covers the ground. Vines
      twist between tree trunks. Sunlight filters through the canopy. One book hovers before him,
      its ending blank. Forest and library merged into one magical place. Text in Times New Roman

      The thread yanked Noah through his window. He tumbled into a forest where trees held floating books on their branches. Stories everywhere. But half were dying. Grey threads. Fading words. He caught a falling book. Blank pages where the ending should be.

      Noah stands before a glowing scroll hanging from a low branch, its golden thread wrapped
      around the bark. He reaches up with both hands to steady it. The scroll unfurls showing a
      story about a girl and her lost voice. It stops mid-sentence. Noah's face shows determination.
      Other stories on nearby branches lean toward him, watching. Hoping. Small forest creatures
      peek from behind trees. His posture straightens with purpose. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      One story pulsed brighter than the rest. Fighting to stay alive. Noah grabbed its thread and steadied it. A girl searching for her lost voice. Beautiful moments. Then nothing. Someone had quit right before the ending. "I'll help you," Noah promised.
