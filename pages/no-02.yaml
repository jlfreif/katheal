      Noah crashes into the forest library of Kathaél—a place where stories live as glowing books
      and scrolls on living tree branches. But it's dying. Books are wrapped in golden chains, pulled
      so tight the spines crack. Pages curl black and crumble to ash. One book falls at Noah's feet—
      he opens it. Every page filled with perfect prose, flawless plotting, heroes who never make
      mistakes. And it's dead. Grey ash inside. He opens another gasping book. Red text scrawled
      across every page: "MUST GET IT RIGHT" "NO WRONG TURNS ALLOWED" "NEVER MAKE MISTAKES" "PERFECT
      ON FIRST TRY." The story underneath is suffocating, desperate to try something and fail and try
      again. But the chains won't let it. A book shatters completely—poof, gone. Noah stares in
      horror. These chains look exactly like his delete key. The atmosphere is dawning horrified
      realization. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah landed hard. The forest library stretched before him—but dying. Books wrapped in golden chains, strangling. He grabbed one gasping book. Opened it. Perfect sentences. Flawless plot. Every character doing exactly the right thing. Dead. Ash. Another book, chains cutting into its spine: "NEVER FAIL" "NO MISTAKES" "GET IT RIGHT FIRST TRY" scrawled in angry red across every page. The story underneath clawed at the pages, trying to breathe, trying to TRY. The chains tightened. The book crumbled. Noah's stomach dropped. He knew those chains. He'd written them.

      An owl swoops down from a branch, landing on a fallen pillar beside Noah. "Welcome to Kathaél,
      young writer," it says sadly. "This is where stories come to live. But yours..." It gestures
      with a wing at the dying books. "You never let them fail. Never let them make mistakes. Never
      let them try wrong paths. You deleted every misstep, every failure, every messy attempt. So
      they came here perfect—and perfected to death." Noah stares at his hands. How many scenes had
      he deleted? How many "failed attempts" had he erased? "Stories need to fail," the owl says
      gently. "They need to try and fail and try again. That's how they live. That's how they
      breathe." A nearby book convulses, chains tightening. Noah reaches for it instinctively. His
      expression shows guilt and determination—this is his fault. He has to fix it. The atmosphere
      is accepting terrible responsibility. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      An owl landed beside him. "You're a writer," it said. "These are your stories. You never let them fail, did you? Never let characters make mistakes or take wrong paths. You deleted every messy attempt." Noah's throat tightened. Every time he'd hit delete. Every "failed attempt" he'd erased. "Stories need to fail," the owl said. "They need to try wrong things. Learn. Struggle. You gave them perfection. Perfection is death." A book nearby shattered to ash. "How do I fix this?" Noah asked. The owl looked at him. "Can you let them be imperfect?"
