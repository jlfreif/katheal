      Noah stands at the threshold between his backyard and a luminous forest,
      gripping a golden thread that stretches forward. One foot rests on ordinary
      grass, the other on glowing moss. Silver-barked trees rise ahead, with more
      golden threads visible like a web connecting everything. His expression mixes
      surprise and nervous excitement.

      The golden thread led through his backyard fence and into a forest that
      definitely was not supposed to be there. Noah's fingers tingled where he held
      the thread, warm and almost alive. Trees with silver bark stood in soft
      blue-grey mist, their leaves catching light like scattered diamonds. He took
      one step forward, then another, unable to stop himself.

    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside a stream where several golden threads float limply in the
      water, their glow fading. A rabbit with unusually wise eyes sits on the bank,
      watching him. The threads look frayed and broken, drifting apart like unraveling
      yarn. Noah's brow furrows with concern as he reaches toward them.

      By the stream, Noah saw what was wrong. Golden threads drifted loose and dull,
      their light flickering like candles in wind. A rabbit with knowing eyes sat
      nearby, and somehow Noah understood: these threads held stories together, and
      something precious was coming undone. His chest tightened. He could walk away,
      or he could try to help.
