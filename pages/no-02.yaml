      Noah runs forward through the threshold between his backyard and a luminous forest,
      one hand gripping the golden thread. His other hand reaches out to balance himself
      as he moves from ordinary grass onto glowing moss. Dozens of golden threads hang
      suspended around him, all frayed and flickering. In the distance, a massive crystal
      structure rises between ancient trees, its facets pulsing weakly.

      The thread tugged Noah forward, and he ran with it. One step through the fence,
      and everything shifted—his backyard became a glowing forest that definitely hadn't
      been there before. "Whoa!" Golden threads hung everywhere, flickering like dying
      stars. He jogged between them, eyes wide. In the distance, something massive rose
      between the trees—a crystal with facets that pulsed weakly, cracks spreading across
      its surface.

    visual: |
      Noah crouches beside a thread at eye level, his hand hovering near its frayed end.
      Words shimmer in the air like ghostly text: "She reached for the door and..."
      then nothing. A rabbit with knowing eyes watches from nearby, ears alert. The great
      crystal structure glows dimly in the background, more threads drifting free.

      "She reached for the door and..." The words floated beside a silver tree, then
      stopped. Noah's eyes widened. "These are actual stories!" He reached toward the
      floating words, and they hummed under his fingertips like a purring cat. A rabbit
      with ancient eyes met his gaze. When it blinked, Noah understood: if the threads
      kept fraying, the stories would die forever. The rabbit tilted its head toward
      the Crystal. Noah jumped to his feet. "I'm a writer. I can help with this."
