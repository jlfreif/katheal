      Noah stands at the threshold between his backyard and a luminous forest,
      gripping the golden thread. One foot rests on ordinary grass, the other on
      glowing moss. Around him, dozens of golden threads hang suspended in the air,
      all trailing off into nothing—stories without endings. His eyes widen at the
      scope of the problem.

      The thread led through his backyard fence into a forest that shouldn't exist.
      Noah stepped through and stopped, breath catching. Everywhere he looked,
      golden threads hung frozen in the air, each one ending abruptly, like
      sentences cut off mid-thought. The whole forest felt like a book with its
      last chapters torn out.

    focus: Decision to act

    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside a small clearing where a single thread hovers at eye
      level, its frayed end pulsing weakly. Beside him, words shimmer in the air
      like ghostly text: "She reached for the door and—" then nothing. A rabbit
      with knowing eyes watches from nearby. Noah reaches toward the frozen story.

      By a silver-barked tree, Noah found a thread that whispered words: "She
      reached for the door and—" Then silence. The story just stopped, waiting.
      A rabbit with ancient eyes sat nearby, and somehow Noah understood: these
      were real stories, stuck forever unless someone helped them end. He was a
      writer. He could fix this.
