      Noah lands in a magnificent forest library. Ancient trees with glowing books on branches. Floating
      scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books flutter playfully past. In the center rises a massive crystalline
      structure with five pedestals arranged in a circle. Each pedestal shows a different puzzle type glowing
      and waiting. Constellation patterns. Word riddles. Mathematical sequences. Musical notes. Physical
      mechanisms. An owl swoops down, landing on one pedestal. The whole library hums with anticipation.
      The atmosphere is wonder meeting challenge.

      Noah landed in a forest library. Books floated like curious birds. Scrolls chimed. An owl swooped down. "Welcome, Solver! You answered the call!" It gestured toward five pedestals surrounding a huge crystal. Each pedestal glowed with a different puzzle. Noah's eyes went wide. This was incredible.

      Noah approaches the first pedestal. Constellation patterns float in the air above it, waiting to be
      arranged. Behind the pedestal, the massive Heart Crystal rises, currently dim and inactive. The owl
      explains that all five patterns connect to challenges throughout the library. Noah studies the constellation
      puzzle, his analytical brain already working. He touches a floating star and it glows brighter. Click.
      The first piece slots into place. His expression shows excitement and determination. This is exactly
      the kind of challenge he loves. The atmosphere celebrates discovery and adventure beginning. Text in

      The owl spoke: "The Heart Crystal is energized by acts of courage, writing them as stories into the Library's books. These stories give people on Earth the strength to keep being brave. If the Crystal fails completely, the stories stop flowing—and courage itself begins to die everywhere. Each pedestal represents a different type of courage challenge that children must solve to re-energize the Heart Crystal," the owl continued. "Can you help?" Noah grinned. "Bring it on."
