      An enormous magical library where books and story-scrolls float in the air on golden
      threads. Many of the threads are fraying and grey, books dimming and fading. Noah stands
      in the center, spinning to take it all in, hands out in amazement and growing alarm. Some
      books flicker like dying lights. Scrolls unravel, their words disappearing. A story hovers
      before him, its ending missing—literally erased, leaving blank pages. The library stretches
      impossibly far in all directions. Beautiful but clearly suffering. Noah's expression shows
      wonder mixed with concern. The atmosphere feels urgent but not yet desperate.

      Noah landed in a library bigger than any building he'd ever seen. Stories floated everywhere
      on golden threads, but half of them were fading, their threads turning grey and fraying.
      He caught a falling book. Its pages were blank where the ending should be. All around him,
      stories died mid-sentence, abandoned by writers who couldn't find the perfect words. The
      sight made his chest tight. Stories deserved better than this.

    visual: |
      Noah stands before a particular scroll that glows slightly brighter than the others, its
      thread still golden but flickering. He reaches out with both hands to steady it, his face
      showing determination. The scroll unfurls showing a story about a girl seeking her lost
      voice—it's almost complete but stops abruptly. Noah's expression shifts from analytical
      to emotionally connected. Around him, other stories seem to lean in, watching, hoping.
      A golden thread extends from the scroll toward his hand, inviting him to help. His posture
      straightens with purpose. The atmosphere shifts from discovery to commitment.

      One story pulsed brighter than the rest, fighting to stay alive. Noah grabbed its thread,
      steadying it. The scroll showed a girl searching for her lost voice, pages filled with
      beautiful moments that suddenly stopped. Someone had given up right before the ending. Noah's
      writer's heart recognized the pattern. He'd done this himself, abandoning stories when the
      perfect ending wouldn't come. "I'll help you," he promised. He'd figure this out somehow.
