      Noah stands at the threshold between his backyard and a luminous forest,
      gripping the golden thread. One foot on ordinary grass, one on glowing moss.
      Dozens of golden threads hang suspended around him, all frayed and flickering.
      In the distance, a great tapestry of light pulses weakly between ancient trees.

      The thread tugged Noah through his backyard fence into a forest that
      shouldn't exist. "Whoa." Golden threads hung everywhere, all frayed at the
      ends, flickering like dying stars. In the distance, something vast and
      glowing pulsed between the trees. It looked like a tapestry made of light,
      but pieces of it were unraveling, threads drifting loose.

    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside a thread at eye level, its frayed end pulsing weakly.
      Words shimmer in the air like ghostly text: "She reached for the door and..."
      then nothing. A rabbit with knowing eyes watches from nearby. The great
      tapestry glows dimly in the background, more threads drifting free.

      "She reached for the door and..." The words floated beside a silver tree,
      then stopped. Noah's stomach tightened. "These are stories," he breathed.
      "Real stories." A rabbit with ancient eyes met his gaze. When it blinked,
      Noah understood: if the threads kept unraveling, the stories would die
      forever. "I'm a writer," he said aloud. "I can help."
