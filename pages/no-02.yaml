  Noah stands at the threshold between his ordinary world and Kathaél—one foot still
  on the grass of his backyard, the other foot stepping onto soft, luminescent moss.
  He's holding onto a golden thread that stretches from his hand forward into a forest
  that shouldn't exist behind his house. His body is angled forward, leaning into
  this new world, his free hand extended for balance. His expression shows a mixture
  of surprise, excitement, and a hint of nervousness—eyebrows raised, mouth slightly
  open. The golden thread he holds glows warmly and appears to be woven from light
  itself. Behind him, his ordinary suburban backyard is visible but already beginning
  to fade at the edges. Ahead of him, Kathaél manifests: trees with silver bark and
  leaves that catch light like prisms, soft blue-grey mist rolling along the ground,
  and more golden threads visible in the air like a web connecting everything. Small
  luminescent flowers dot the moss. In the middle distance, a gentle creature—perhaps
  a rabbit with unusually wise eyes—sits watching him, as if waiting to see if he'll
  fully commit to entering.

  The golden thread led Noah through his backyard fence and into a world he'd only dreamed about. A soft voice whispered that something precious was coming undone, and he could help.
