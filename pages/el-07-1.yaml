      Elise emerges through the vine archway into the Garden of Whispers—a place where flowers
      grow that reflect the words spoken near them. The garden is filled with blooms of every color,
      each showing images within their petals: memories, feelings, truths. The fading paperbird
      leads her to the center where a pool of still water reflects the sky perfectly. Elise kneels,
      setting down her sketchbook. She can feel that something important must happen here.

      The Garden of Whispers waited—beautiful and expectant. Elise knelt by the pool, her paperbird
      flickering weakly beside her. The garden seemed to be asking: "What do you see? What do you
      truly see?"

      Elise looks into the pool and sees not just her reflection but also images of all the things
      she's observed but never spoken aloud: beauty she noticed but didn't name, kindness she saw
      but didn't acknowledge, fears she felt but never shared, truths she understood but kept quiet.
      The paperbird hovers above the pool, and Elise realizes—it's fading because its story needs
      to be voiced, and she's the one who can truly see what that story is. Her hands hover over
      the water, trembling. She opens her mouth to speak, but fear catches her words.

      The pool showed Elise everything she'd seen but never said—all the silent observations, the
      noticed beauty, the understood truths. "Speak them," the garden whispered. But Elise's voice
      caught in her throat. What if her words weren't enough?
