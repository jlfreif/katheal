  Front cover illustration. Micah (9 years old, half-Japanese and half-Caucasian,
  black hair, black eyes, medium height, balanced build, coordinated and powerful
  physique, grey t-shirt, black shorts, black sneakers) is captured mid-motion,
  leaping dynamically through the air with athletic grace. Golden threads flow around
  him like wind currents, some forming musical notes (representing his trombone),
  others creating parkour-style pathways and adventure symbols. His expression is
  energetic and bright, full of restless motion and humor. Behind him, the Library
  of Kathaél appears as an adventurous landscape with climbing surfaces and dynamic
  architecture. The Heart Crystal towers in the background, its facets creating
  prismatic light that follows his movement. Some threads pause in stillness, suggesting
  moments of calm within motion. The atmosphere is energetic yet thoughtful, with
  watercolor washes of dynamic grays, vibrant blues, honey golds, and warm creams.
  Delicate ink linework captures the energy of movement and magical flow. The scene
  captures Micah's constant motion meeting the magic of mindful pauses.

  At the top of the cover, in elegant script: "The Library of Kathaél"
  Below that, in bold lettering: "Micah's Journey"
  At the bottom: "Courage to Take a Breath"
