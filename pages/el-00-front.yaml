  Front cover illustration. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair, hazel eyes, slim build,
  black leggings, light pink t-shirt, white sneakers) is mid-dance, one leg extended
  gracefully, arms flowing expressively. Golden threads swirl around her like ribbons,
  moving with her choreography. Her expression is confident and joyful, fully present
  in the moment. Behind her, the Library of Kathaél glows with warm light, and the Heart
  Crystal rises majestically, its facets reflecting colors that dance like her movements.
  Musical notes made of golden light float through the air, intertwining with the threads.
  Faded gray elements (representing dormant stories) are beginning to glow with color
  as she dances near them. The atmosphere is warm and expressive, with watercolor washes
  of soft pinks, honey golds, and mist blues. Delicate ink linework captures the grace
  of her movement and the flowing threads. The scene embodies creative expression meeting
  magical transformation.

  At the top of the cover, in elegant script: "The Library of Kathaél"
  Below that, in bold lettering: "Elise's Journey"
  At the bottom: "Courage to Be Yourself"
