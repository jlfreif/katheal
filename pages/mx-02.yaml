    visual: |
      Max steps from his ordinary backyard into a magical glowing forest. Enormous trees rise
      around him, their trunks woven with golden threads. Between the trees stretch elaborate
      obstacle courses - rope bridges, climbing walls, balance beams, rope swings - all
      integrated into the forest. But half the courses hang broken, dark, and lifeless. In the
      distance, a massive crystal structure (the Heart Crystal) pulses weakly with failing light,
      cracks visible across its surface. Max stands in wonder, taking it all in. The atmosphere
      is magical but troubled. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom.

      One step took Max from his backyard into a forest that glowed. Obstacle courses stretched between enormous trees. But half the courses hung broken, threads dark and lifeless. In the distance, a massive crystal structure pulsed weakly, cracks spreading. "Whoa," Max breathed. "This is Kathaél."

    visual: |
      Max stands before the nearest broken obstacle course. A fox with ancient, knowing eyes sits
      beside the course, watching Max intently. The fox's gaze moves between Max, the broken
      course, and the distant failing Heart Crystal. Golden threads connect everything but they're
      dim and flickering. Max's expression shows understanding and determination - he's already
      figuring out the challenge, cracking his knuckles in preparation. The atmosphere is one of
      accepting a challenge. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom.

      A fox sat beside the nearest course, watching him with ancient eyes. Max understood somehow: the courses powered the crystal. The crystal powered everything. And everything was failing. The fox's gaze moved to Max, then to the broken course, then back. Max cracked his knuckles. "Okay. I'm good at challenges. Let's do this."
