    visual: |
      Max steps from his ordinary backyard into the magnificent Library of Lost Patterns. Ancient
      trees with glowing books on branches rise around him. Floating scrolls chime like wind chimes.
      In the center, five pedestals surround the massive Heart Crystal. The mathematical sequences
      pedestal glows before him, covered in number patterns and equations that shift and change. But
      half the sequences are broken, flickering and dark. The Heart Crystal pulses weakly with failing
      light, cracks visible across its surface. Max stands in wonder, taking it all in. His analytical
      mind already processing the challenge. The atmosphere is magical but troubled. Text in Times New

      One step took Max from his backyard into the Library of Lost Patterns. Ancient trees glowed with books. Scrolls chimed. The mathematical sequences pedestal stood before him, covered in number patterns. But half the sequences hung broken, dark and lifeless. In the distance, the Heart Crystal pulsed weakly, cracks spreading. "Whoa," Max breathed. "This is incredible."

    visual: |
      Max stands before the mathematical sequences pedestal. A fox with ancient, knowing eyes sits
      beside it, watching Max intently. The fox's gaze moves between Max, the broken sequences, and
      the distant failing Heart Crystal. Number patterns float in the air—Fibonacci spirals, prime
      sequences, geometric progressions—all flickering and incomplete. Golden threads connect everything
      but they're dim. Max's expression shows understanding and determination—he's already figuring out
      the challenge, cracking his knuckles in preparation. The atmosphere is one of accepting a challenge.

      A fox sat beside the pedestal, watching him with ancient eyes. Max understood somehow: the sequences powered the crystal. The crystal powered everything. And everything was failing. The fox's gaze moved to Max, then to the broken patterns, then back. Max cracked his knuckles. "Okay. I'm good at patterns. Let's do this."
