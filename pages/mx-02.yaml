      A vast clearing filled with broken mechanical wonders—clockwork creatures frozen mid-step,
      crystal bridges that should connect but don't, water wheels stopped above flowing streams.
      Max stands in the center, turning in amazement and growing alarm. Everything is beautifully
      designed but completely non-functional. Gears scattered across moss. Broken springs. A
      magnificent clockwork bird lies on its side, wings half-extended. Golden threads that
      should power these mechanisms hang limp and grey. Max crouches to examine a gear, his
      expression showing wonder mixed with the detective-mind clicking into action.

      Max stepped into a graveyard of failed inventions. Clockwork wonders lay broken everywhere—
      each one brilliantly designed, perfectly calculated, completely overthought. He picked up
      a gear. The craftsmanship was flawless, but something about it felt forced, joyless. These
      mechanisms hadn't failed because of bad design. They'd failed because whoever made them
      had forgotten to let magic be playful.

    visual: |
      Max stands before a particular clockwork creature—a deer made of brass and crystal, frozen
      mid-leap. Its internal mechanisms visible through crystal panels show perfect engineering
      but no life. Max places both hands on it gently, his expression shifting from analytical
      to empathetic. A faint golden thread connects from his hands to the deer's heart-mechanism.
      Around him, other broken machines seem to lean in hopefully. His face shows determination—
      not to fix them with formulas, but to understand what they need. The atmosphere shifts from
      observation to commitment.

      One clockwork deer caught his eye, frozen mid-leap, beautiful and dead. Max touched its
      crystal heart, feeling the mechanism inside—perfect gears, precise timing, zero joy. He
      understood suddenly. These inventions needed more than engineering. They needed someone to
      play with them, experiment, try things just to see what happened. "I can help you," he
      promised the deer. Not with calculations. With curiosity.
