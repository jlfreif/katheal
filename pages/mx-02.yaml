      Max lands in the magnificent Library of Kathaél. Ancient trees with glowing books on
      branches rise around him. Floating scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books flutter playfully past.
      In the center rises the massive crystalline Heart Crystal with five pedestals arranged in a circle.
      The Obstacle Courses pedestal glows before him—floating platforms, rope swings, rotating handholds,
      and balance beams suspended in the air, all woven with golden threads. But half the obstacles hang
      broken, threads dark and lifeless, platforms frozen mid-rotation. Max stands in wonder, his athlete's
      eye immediately assessing the courses. The atmosphere is magical but troubled. Text in Times New

      One step took Max from his backyard into the Library of Kathaél. Books floated like curious birds. Scrolls chimed. The Obstacle Courses pedestal glowed before him, surrounded by floating platforms, rope swings, and rotating handholds. But half the obstacles hung broken, threads dark and lifeless. In the distance, the Heart Crystal pulsed weakly, cracks spreading. "Whoa," Max breathed. "This place is incredible."

      The fox swoops down and lands beside the Obstacle Courses pedestal. "The Library holds every
      story of courage ever told," it explains. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People
      forget how to keep trying after they stumble. The obstacle courses especially—people give up when
      challenges adapt and change. They need someone who persists. Can you help?" Max looks at the
      broken courses around the pedestal—obstacles that should move and flow but are frozen and
      incomplete. He realizes these courses need someone who adapts to change. His expression shows
      determination and excitement—this is exactly his kind of challenge. Golden threads appear faintly,
      guiding him deeper into the Library. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      A fox watched from a branch. "The Library holds every story of courage ever told," it said. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People forget how to keep trying after they stumble. The obstacle courses especially—people give up when challenges adapt. They need someone who persists. Can you help?" Max studied the frozen obstacles. They needed someone who could handle change. "I'm good at challenges," Max said, grinning. "Let's do this." Golden threads appeared, leading deeper into the Library.
