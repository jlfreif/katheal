    visual: |
      Max stands at the threshold between his backyard and a glowing forest,
      gripping the golden thread. One foot on grass, one on luminous moss.
      Challenge courses stretch between trees, their obstacles frozen mid-motion.
      In the distance, the Heart Crystal rises, its facets cracked and dim.
      His athletic build is poised for action.

      The thread tugged Max forward, and he grabbed it. One step took him from
      his driveway into a forest that glowed like someone painted it with light.
      Challenge courses wound between trees, their obstacles frozen wrong, half-built.
      The golden threads around them flickered weakly. A massive crystal structure
      rose ahead, cracks spreading across its surface. Something here needed fixing.

    focus: Decision to act

    visual: |
      Max kneels beside a frozen challenge course, touching an obstacle that
      should move but doesn't. Golden threads connected to it pulse weakly.
      A fox with knowing eyes watches from nearby. The Heart Crystal glows
      dimly in the background. Max's expression shows determination and
      competitive focus kicking in.

      Max knelt beside a frozen balance beam. It should have been moving, creating
      a challenge, but it hung still and grey. He pushed it, and it creaked sadly.
      The threads connected to it flickered like dying stars. A fox watched him
      with ancient eyes, and somehow Max understood: these challenges had been
      abandoned mid-attempt. "I don't quit," Max said, standing. "Let me help."
