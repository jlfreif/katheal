    visual: |
      Max steps from his ordinary backyard into a forest that glows. Enormous trees rise around him,
      and woven between them are obstacle courses—rope bridges, climbing walls, balance beams, all
      woven with golden threads. The courses look athletic and challenging, like the ultimate training
      ground. But half the courses hang broken, threads dark and lifeless, platforms collapsed. In the
      distance, a massive crystal structure pulses weakly, cracks spreading across its surface. Max
      stands in wonder, taking it all in. His athlete's eye immediately assessing the courses. The
      atmosphere is magical but troubled. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      One step took Max from his backyard into a forest that glowed. Obstacle courses stretched between enormous trees—rope bridges, climbing walls, balance beams, all woven with golden threads. But half the courses hung broken, threads dark and lifeless. In the distance, a massive crystal structure pulsed weakly, cracks spreading across its surface. "Whoa," Max breathed. "This is Kathaél."

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Max stands beside the nearest obstacle course. A fox with ancient, knowing eyes sits beside it,
      watching Max intently. Somehow Max understands: the courses powered the crystal. The crystal
      powered everything. And everything was failing. The fox's gaze moves between Max, the broken
      course, and the distant failing Heart Crystal. The course has rope swings, rotating handholds,
      balance beams—all flickering and incomplete. Golden threads connect everything but they're dim.
      Max's expression shows understanding and determination—he's already sizing up the challenge,
      cracking his knuckles in preparation. The atmosphere is one of accepting a challenge. Text in

      A fox sat beside the nearest course, watching him with ancient eyes. Max understood somehow: the courses powered the crystal. The crystal powered everything. And everything was failing. The fox's gaze moved to Max, then to the broken course, then back. "You want me to fix it?" Max asked. The fox didn't move. Max cracked his knuckles. "Okay. I'm good at challenges. Let's do this."
