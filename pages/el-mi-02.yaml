    focus: Discovery of the problem

    visual: |
      A grove filled with magical performers frozen in mid-performance. A dancer balances
      on one toe, her arms extended in an impossible arc, completely motionless. Musicians
      hold instruments mid-note, their expressions captured in concentration. Elise (9
      years old, long brown hair, graceful and slim) enters the clearing, her eyes wide
      with concern. She reaches tentatively toward the frozen dancer. Golden threads
      overhead flicker weakly, their glow fading. The whole scene has a twilight quality,
      as if time itself is struggling.

      Elise danced into the grove and stopped mid-turn, breathless. Performers everywhere,
      frozen like statues. A dancer hung mid-leap, one foot pointed, arms spread—exactly
      the pose Elise had just been practicing. Musicians held silent instruments. Even
      the trees seemed to hold their breath. "What happened to you?" she whispered,
      reaching toward the dancer's outstretched hand.

    focus: Decision to act together

    visual: |
      Micah (9 years old, black hair, athletic half-Japanese build, constantly in motion)
      enters from the opposite side, also reaching toward the frozen dancer. His hand and
      Elise's nearly touch. Both children's faces show recognition and relief at finding
      someone else who sees the problem. The golden threads pulse once, weakly, as if
      acknowledging their combined presence. The frozen performers remain motionless,
      but the cousins' determination creates a subtle warmth in the air.

    text: |
      A sound made her turn. Micah stood on the other side of the frozen dancer, his
      hand extended just like hers. "Elise!" His face broke into a grin despite the
      strangeness around them. "You see it too. They're stuck." She nodded. "The magic
      is fading." Micah's expression turned serious. "Then let's fix it. Together."
