      Elise steps through golden light into the magnificent Library of Kathaél. Ancient trees
      with glowing books on branches rise around her. Floating scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books
      flutter playfully past. In the center, five pedestals surround the massive Heart Crystal, cracked
      and dimming. The musical notes pedestal glows with rhythmic pulses. Elise (9 years old, long brown
      hair, slim, wearing black leggings and light pink t-shirt, white sneakers) stands in awe. Running
      footsteps. Micah (9 years old, black hair, athletic, wearing grey t-shirt and black shorts) bursts
      into the chamber from another golden doorway, skidding to a stop when he sees her. Their eyes
      meet in surprise and delight. The atmosphere is wonder meeting family. Text in Times New Roman

      Elise stepped through golden light into the Library of Kathaél. Ancient trees glowed with books. Scrolls chimed. Five pedestals surrounded a massive crystal. Running footsteps. "Micah?" Her cousin burst in from another doorway. "Elise? You're here too?" They grinned at each other. "Look at all these pedestals," Micah said, eyes wide. "This is huge."

    visual: |
      Elise and Micah stand before their respective pedestals. Elise examines the musical notes pedestal
      where glowing notes float and chime. Micah studies the physical mechanisms pedestal with its gears
      and levers. The owl swoops down between them. "The Library holds every story of courage ever told,"
      it explains. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People forget how to keep trying. How to
      face their fears. Each pedestal needs someone with special skills. Can you help?" Elise and Micah
      exchange looks across the chamber. They're cousins, family, and now teammates in this challenge. Both
      nod. Golden threads pulse, leading deeper into the Library where their individual challenges await.
      The Heart Crystal hums weakly behind them. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The owl appeared. "The Library holds every story of courage ever told," it said. "When patterns break, the stories can't flow. People forget how to keep trying. How to face their fears." Elise thought of her favorite dance stories. Micah thought of heroes who never gave up. "Each pedestal needs someone special," the owl continued. "Can you help?" They glanced at each other across the chamber. Cousins. Family. Teammates now. "We can try," Elise said. Micah nodded. "Let's do this." Golden threads pulsed brighter, leading them forward.
