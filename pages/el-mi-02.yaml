      Elise steps from the mirror into a vast forest clearing. The ground beneath her is covered
      with glowing pathways that look like dance floors—shimmering surfaces marked with footprint
      patterns that pulse faintly with rhythm. But most of the paths are dark and broken, their
      light flickering weakly. Golden threads connect the paths to each other and to a massive
      crystal structure visible in the distance through the trees (the Heart Crystal), cracked
      and dimming. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair, slim, wearing black leggings and light
      pink t-shirt, white sneakers) stands at the clearing's edge, her expression showing wonder
      mixed with determination. The air hums with a faint, broken beat. Micah (9 years old, black
      hair, athletic, wearing grey t-shirt and black shorts) runs into the clearing from another
      path, skidding to a stop when he sees her. Morning light filters through the trees.

      One step through the mirror took Elise from her bedroom into a glowing forest. Rhythm-paths stretched across the clearing like dance floors, marked with footprints that pulsed faint beats. But half the paths lay dark and broken. In the distance, a massive crystal cracked louder. Footsteps. "Micah?" Her cousin skidded to a stop. "Elise? You're here too?" He grinned. "The paths are broken," he said. "Nothing's moving."

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Elise steps onto the nearest rhythm-path, her white sneakers hitting the glowing footprints.
      She starts to move—a sharp pop-and-lock sequence, feet hitting the beats. The path flickers
      brighter where she steps, but dims again behind her. Micah jumps onto another path, trying
      a running leap across the footprints. His path glows faintly then fades. Both are moving
      fast, testing different approaches, but the paths stay mostly dark. Sweat beads on Elise's
      forehead. The golden threads pulse weakly, responding but not fully activating. In the
      distance, more broken paths stretch through the forest, waiting. The air vibrates with
      incomplete rhythm. Their expressions show determination mixed with frustration.

      "Maybe if we dance on them, they'll light up again?" Elise stepped onto a path. Her feet hit the glowing footprints—boom, tap, step. The path flickered brighter, then dimmed. Micah jumped onto another path, running the pattern. It glowed, then faded. They tried faster. Harder. The paths flickered but wouldn't hold. Elise wiped sweat from her forehead. "We're missing something."
