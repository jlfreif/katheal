      A forest clearing filled with frozen performers. Three dancers are suspended mid-leap,
      their bodies arched gracefully in the air, clothes and hair caught in impossible stillness.
      Two singers stand with mouths open, hands raised expressively, frozen in the middle of a note.
      Golden threads connect them all, dulled and tangled. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair,
      slim, wearing black leggings and provence t-shirt) stands at the clearing's edge, one hand
      reaching toward a frozen dancer, her expression a mix of wonder and concern. Micah (9 years old,
      black hair, athletic, wearing grey t-shirt and black shorts) crouches near a frozen singer,
      tilting his head as he examines the golden threads. Morning light filters through the trees,
      making the frozen scene eerily beautiful.

      Elise stepped into the clearing and froze. Dancers hung in mid-air, singers held impossible notes, all turned to statues. Micah appeared from another path, moving fast until he saw. "They're stuck," he whispered. "Like someone hit pause."

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Elise mirrors the pose of the frozen dancer, standing on one leg with arms extended, trying
      to match the graceful arch. Micah attempts a frozen leap nearby, his body mid-jump, arms
      spread wide. Both children are fully engaged, faces showing concentration and effort. The
      golden threads around them pulse faintly, responding to their movement. The frozen performers
      remain still, but the threads connecting them brighten slightly where Elise and Micah move.
      Soft particles of light drift through the air. The forest seems to lean in, watching.

      Elise copied the dancer's pose. Micah leaped into the air, matching a frozen jump. For a heartbeat, the golden threads hummed. Then they landed. The clearing stayed silent. They'd need more than copying.
