      A chamber in the Library that actively challenges Maya—every riddle reveals infinite layers
      the moment she looks at it. One riddle about "home" unfolds into a thousand meanings. Another
      about "journey" splits into endless interpretations. The words themselves multiply and shift,
      showing her all their depth simultaneously. This isn't her failing—this is the Library pushing
      her limits deliberately. Can she read this much depth? This fast? This complex? Maya's eyes are
      wide, trying to track it all. Golden threads multiply into thousands of connections. Through
      the windows, the Heart Crystal pulses frantically. The atmosphere is intense sensory overload
      of meaning. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The Library threw everything at Maya at once. Every riddle bloomed into infinite meanings. Home became shelter, family, belonging, safety, memory, dream. Journey became path, quest, growth, struggle, adventure, return. The Heart Crystal's challenge was escalating—could she see this much depth? This fast? This complex? Maya's head spun. This was genuinely hard. Not because she was doing it wrong. Because it WAS this hard.

      Maya takes a breath and stops trying to see every meaning. A single firefly appears, cutting
      through the chaos with one simple light. Maya focuses only on it—watching its glow, seeing its
      warmth, noticing its simple beauty. As she does, the overwhelming riddles settle. The challenge
      was never "see everything at once." It was "know how to focus when faced with too much." The
      firefly lands on an open book. One riddle glows there, manageable now. Golden threads calm into
      purposeful patterns. Maya's expression shifts to understanding. One meaning at a time, even in
      chaos. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Maya stopped trying to see everything. One firefly appeared. She focused only on it. Watched its flight. Saw its glow. Felt its warmth. The chaos settled. The challenge wasn't seeing everything at once—that was impossible. The challenge was learning to focus when overwhelmed. "Okay, I get it," Maya said to the firefly. "One meaning at a time. Even when there's a thousand." The firefly pulsed agreement. Strategy figured out.
