      A garden where Maya's earlier work is failing. Flowers she painted bright are fading back
      to grey. Colors she restored drip away like rain washing off paint. Maya sits on the ground,
      paint-stained hands in her lap, watching her authentic work disappear. Her paint set lies
      open but she doesn't reach for it. Her usually bold posture is slumped. The pink streak
      in her hair seems duller. Around her, the garden dims back toward the lifeless grey it was
      before. Her expression shows deep exhaustion and doubt. The atmosphere weighs heavy with
      defeat and the fear that being yourself isn't enough.

      Maya left the rainbow bridge searching for what was missing. But everywhere she looked, everything she'd painted faded back to grey. Every bold color, every authentic expression, washing away. The world kept choosing safe over vibrant. Maybe being yourself didn't matter if no one valued it. Maybe she should have learned to blend.

      Maya still sitting, but her eyes catch on one tiny flower that refuses to fade—a small
      bloom holding onto the shocking pink she painted it, defiant and bright in the sea of grey.
      It's small but it's holding. Around it, a few blades of grass stay green, a few leaves
      keep their blue. Not everything is fading. Some things remember. Maya reaches toward the
      pink flower, her expression shifting from defeat to wondering recognition. A faint golden
      thread connects from her to the flower. The atmosphere lightens slightly, stubborn hope
      emerging.

      But one flower refused to fade. A tiny bloom held its shocking pink, defiant in the grey. Maya crawled toward it. Small. Stubborn. Still itself. Around it, a few other touches of her color persisted. Not everything had given up. If that tiny flower could stay vibrant, maybe she could too.
