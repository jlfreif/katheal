      Maya stands in a garden that actively challenges her—every single thing reveals infinite
      layers the moment she looks at it. A flower blooms into fractal patterns. A stone unfolds
      into geological eons. Wind carries visible streams of stories and memories. The garden itself
      is SHOWING her all this depth simultaneously, like it's testing how much she can handle. Her
      eyes are wide, trying to track it all. Golden threads multiply into thousands of connections.
      This isn't her failing—this is the garden pushing her limits deliberately. The Heart Crystal
      pulses in the distance, its challenge escalating. The atmosphere is intense sensory overload.

      The garden threw everything at Maya at once. Every flower bloomed into fractal patterns. Every stone unfolded geological eons. Wind carried visible memories. The Heart Crystal's challenge was escalating—could she see this much depth? This fast? This complex? Maya's head spun. This was genuinely hard. Not because she was doing it wrong. Because it WAS this hard.

    focus: Finding the solution through focus
    visual: |
      Maya takes a breath and stops trying to see everything. A single firefly appears, cutting
      through the chaos with one simple light. Maya focuses only on it—tracking its movement,
      seeing its glow, noticing the warmth. As she does, the overwhelming garden settles. The
      challenge was never "see everything at once." It was "know how to focus when challenged with
      too much." The firefly lands on her hand. Golden threads calm into purposeful patterns. Maya's
      expression shifts to understanding. She's figured out the strategy. One thing at a time, even
      in chaos.

      Maya stopped trying to see everything. One firefly appeared. She focused only on it. Tracked its flight. Saw its glow. Felt its warmth. The chaos settled. The challenge wasn't seeing everything at once—that was impossible. The challenge was learning to focus when overwhelmed. "Okay, I get it," Maya said to the firefly. "One thing at a time. Even when there's a million things." The firefly pulsed agreement. Strategy figured out.
