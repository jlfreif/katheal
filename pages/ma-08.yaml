      Maya sits overwhelmed in a complex garden where every single thing has infinite depth.
      She tries to see beneath the surface of everything at once—too many layers, too much hidden
      meaning, endless complexity. Her head hurts. Her eyes water. Everywhere she looks, there's
      another layer beneath, and another beneath that. She can't process it all. Her expression
      shows exhausted confusion and defeat. The golden threads around her tangle into knots. The
      atmosphere is overwhelming chaos of too much depth.

      Maya tried to see beneath everything at once. Every flower held universes. Every stone contained stories. Every breath of wind carried meaning. Too much. Too deep. Too complex. She couldn't hold it all. Maybe surfaces were easier for a reason. Her head spun. She couldn't do this.

      Maya closes her eyes, shutting out the overwhelming complexity. In the darkness, something
      simple appears—one small light, warm and steady. When she opens her eyes, she sees a single
      firefly glowing. She doesn't try to see its entire complexity, doesn't analyze its depths.
      She just appreciates it for what it is—one small beautiful light in the darkness. The
      firefly lands on her hand, warm and simple. Around it, the chaos calms. Her expression
      shifts from overwhelmed to peaceful. She doesn't need to see everything at once. One thing
      at a time.

      Maya closed her eyes against the chaos. In the dark, one firefly appeared. She opened her eyes and just watched it. One small light. That's all. She didn't try to understand everything about it. Just appreciated what it was. The firefly glowed steady and warm. One thing at a time. That was enough.
