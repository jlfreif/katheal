      Maya stands frozen center stage in a vast amphitheater packed with
      shadow-audiences, each row demanding something different from her.
      "Be proper!" "Stop showing off!" "Where's your training?" Dark clouds
      gather overhead. The Heart Crystal cracks audibly. A nearby performance
      dissolves into grey smoke. Her athletic frame looks small and vulnerable.

      The amphitheater filled with shadow-audiences, all judging. One section
      wanted perfect ballet. Another wanted serious art. Another wanted her
      to stop being so loud, so bold, so much. Dark clouds gathered. The
      Crystal cracked louder. A performance beside her dissolved into smoke.
      "I'm just me," Maya whispered. "Is that really not enough?"

    focus: Inner doubt and discouragement

    visual: |
      Maya sits cross-legged on the empty stage, arms wrapped around herself,
      her pink-streaked hair hanging forward to hide her face. The shadow-audiences
      loom in the darkness. Her paint-stained hands rest empty in her lap. A
      small butterfly lands nearby, its wings dull grey. One weak thread glows
      faintly.

      Maya sank down onto the stage, trying to make herself smaller. Maybe
      everyone was right. Maybe her wild dancing and mixed styles and loud
      colors were just showing off. Maybe she should be more like... she didn't
      even know who. The butterfly landed nearby, its wings grey. But Maya
      noticed it hadn't flown away. And one thread still glowed, faint but real.
