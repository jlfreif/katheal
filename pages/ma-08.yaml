      A chamber in the Library that actively challenges Maya—a massive canvas appears that requires
      her to paint with genuine emotion, not just technique. She begins painting, but the moment she
      opens herself emotionally, ALL her feelings flood in at once. Joy, fear, sadness, anger, hope,
      confusion—they all pour onto the canvas simultaneously. The painting writhes and shifts chaotically,
      colors bleeding together, images forming and dissolving. This isn't her failing—this is the
      Library pushing her limits deliberately. Can she hold this much feeling? This much honesty? This
      much depth? Maya's eyes are wide, overwhelmed. The painting pulses with unstable emotion. Through
      the windows, the Heart Crystal pulses frantically. The atmosphere is intense emotional overload.

      The Library threw everything at Maya at once. A canvas that needed real emotion. She opened herself and ALL her feelings flooded in. Joy, fear, sadness, anger, hope. The painting writhed chaotically, colors bleeding, images shifting. The Heart Crystal's challenge was escalating—could she paint with this much emotion? This much honesty? This complex? Maya's head spun. This was genuinely hard. Not because she was doing it wrong. Because it WAS this hard.

    visual: |
      Maya takes a breath and stops trying to paint every emotion at once. A single firefly appears,
      cutting through the chaos with one simple light. Maya focuses only on it—watching its gentle
      glow, feeling its quiet warmth, painting just that one simple feeling of calm presence. As she
      does, the overwhelming chaos settles. The painting stabilizes around the firefly, becoming real
      and alive. The challenge was never "express everything at once." It was "know how to focus when
      faced with emotional overwhelm." The firefly lands on the canvas, now part of the living painting.
      Golden threads calm into purposeful patterns. Maya's expression shifts to understanding. One
      emotion at a time, painted with honesty. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Maya stopped trying to paint everything. One firefly appeared. She focused only on it. Painted its gentle glow. Its quiet warmth. Just that. The chaos settled. The painting became real, alive. The challenge wasn't expressing everything at once—that was impossible. The challenge was learning to focus when overwhelmed. "Okay, I get it," Maya said to the firefly. "One feeling at a time. Painted honestly." The firefly pulsed agreement. Strategy figured out.
