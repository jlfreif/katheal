    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Elise kneels in the meadow, holding her watercolor set in one hand and a
      paintbrush in the other. She leans forward, carefully painting a faded flower,
      her tongue poking out in concentration. Paint beads on the flower's surface
      like water on wax, refusing to sink in. Several other painted flowers nearby
      show the same failed attempts.

      Elise opened her watercolor set. If colors were fading, she would paint them
      back. She chose her best rose pink and touched her brush to a pale flower,
      moving slowly, carefully. The paint sat on the petals like drops of water,
      sliding off without leaving a trace. She tried again, pressing harder.

    visual: |
      Elise sits back on her heels, brush lowering to her side. Her brow furrows
      with frustration and confusion. Around her, failed attempts mark several
      flowers with paint that sits on their surfaces without sinking in. Rabbits
      and birds watch from the meadow's edges with sympathetic, knowing eyes.

      No matter how carefully she painted, the colors wouldn't stay. Elise's stomach
      tightened with that familiar worry: what if she wasn't enough? The meadow
      stretched endlessly around her, thousands of faded flowers waiting. Small
      animals watched from the edges, their eyes gentle but offering no answers.
      Maybe someone else knew what she was doing wrong.
