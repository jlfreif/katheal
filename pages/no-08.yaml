      Above Noah, dozens of story-threads have knotted into a massive tangle, words
      jumbled together. The Heart-Loom pulses dimly in the distance, more threads
      unraveling. Rain begins to fall, blurring the frozen words. The lantern
      beside him has gone dark.

      The stories he'd tried to fix had knotted into each other, a massive tangle
      of analyzed endings and overthought beginnings. The Heart-Loom pulsed dimmer
      than ever. Rain began to fall. "I knew," Noah whispered. "I knew presence
      mattered more than understanding. And I still couldn't stop trying to figure
      it all out."

    visual: |
      Noah sits slumped against a tree, knees to his chest. His notebook lies in
      the mud, pages covered in crossed-out endings. Rain smears the ink. A small
      bird sits on a branch above. One faint story-thread nearby pulses weakly,
      still holding on.

      "I don't understand any of this." Noah's voice cracked. His notebook lay ruined,
      full of analyzed patterns that missed what the stories actually needed. The bird
      above didn't sing. It just stayed. Then Noah noticed something. The tangled stories
      weren't dead. They were still glowing, faintly. Waiting. He didn't understand why,
      but his presence had kept them from fading completely.
