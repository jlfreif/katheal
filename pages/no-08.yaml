      Above Noah, dozens of story-threads have knotted into a massive tangle, words
      jumbled together. Where they touched, sparks flew. The Crystal pulsed dimly—then
      one of its facets cracked with a sound like breaking glass. Rain began to fall,
      cold and heavy. The lantern beside him has gone dark.

      The stories he'd tried to fix had knotted into each other, a massive tangle
      of analyzed endings and overthought beginnings. Above Noah, dozens of story-threads
      had knotted into a massive tangle. Where they touched, sparks flew. The Crystal
      pulsed dimly—then one of its facets cracked with a sound like breaking glass.
      Rain began to fall, cold and heavy. "I knew," Noah whispered. "I knew presence
      mattered more than understanding. And I still couldn't stop trying to figure
      it all out."

      Noah sits slumped against a tree, knees to his chest. His notebook lies in
      the mud, pages covered in crossed-out endings. Rain smears the ink. A small
      bird sits on a branch above. One faint story-thread nearby pulses weakly,
      still holding on.

      "I keep trying to help, but..." Noah's voice trailed off. His notebook lay in the
      mud, pages covered in crossed-out attempts. He'd tried so hard. Maybe trying wasn't
      enough. The bird above didn't sing. It just stayed. Then Noah noticed something.
      The tangled stories weren't dead. They were still glowing, faintly. Waiting. He
      didn't understand why, but his presence had kept them from fading completely.
