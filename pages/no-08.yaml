  Noah sits slumped against the base of an enormous ancient tree, his arms wrapped
  around his knees, head bowed down so his forehead rests on his arms. His sandy
  blond hair falls forward, hiding his face. His notebook lies on the ground beside
  him, pages fluttering in a gentle breeze, several pages torn out and scattered.
  Above and around him, the Heart-Loom threads form a massive, complicated tangle—
  dozens of golden strands twisted and knotted together, some glowing weakly, some
  barely visible, the whole structure sagging under its own weight. It's clearly
  worse than when he started, or at least seems that way. The light in this part of
  Kathaél is dimmer, more grey than golden, as if reflecting his emotional state.
  Rain is just beginning to fall—small drops visible in the air, darkening the bark
  of the tree. His ukulele lies beside him, one string broken. In the background,
  the path he's been following disappears into fog. The overall atmosphere is heavy,
  discouraged, lonely. A small bird sits on a low branch above him, silent, just
  present—not offering solutions, but witnessing his struggle.

  Noah felt like every choice made things worse. Maybe he wasn't the hero of this story after all.
