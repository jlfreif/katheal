      Above Noah, dozens of story-threads have knotted into a massive tangle, words
      jumbled together into nonsense. His crossed-out endings float through the mess
      like debris. Rain begins to fall, blurring the frozen words. The whole structure
      sags, stories collapsing into each other.

      The stories he'd tried to fix had knotted into each other. Endings he'd forced
      had tangled with beginnings he'd ignored. The whole mess hung above him like
      a storm cloud of ruined tales. Rain began to fall, and Noah realized: his need
      to control every ending had made everything worse.

    visual: |
      Noah sits slumped against a tree, knees pulled to his chest, face hidden.
      His notebook lies open in the mud, pages covered in crossed-out endings, rain
      smearing the ink. Torn pages scatter around him. A small bird sits on a branch
      above, silent witness to his despair.

    text: |
      Noah pressed his face into his knees. Every story he touched, he broke. He
      couldn't stop himself from revising, controlling, perfecting. And now look.
      His notebook lay ruined in the mud, full of endings that belonged to him, not
      to the stories. The bird above didn't sing. It just stayed.
