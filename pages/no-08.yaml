      Above Noah, the Heart-Loom threads form a massive, complicated tangle,
      dozens of golden strands twisted and knotted together. Some glow weakly,
      others are barely visible. The whole structure sags under its own weight.
      Rain begins to fall, darkening the bark of the ancient tree behind him.
      The light here is dim and grey.

      The tangle was worse than before. Much worse. Threads that Noah had tried
      to straighten were now knotted into others, and threads he hadn't touched
      had somehow gotten caught in the mess. Rain began to fall, cold drops
      sliding down his face. The path behind him had disappeared into fog.

    visual: |
      Noah sits slumped against the base of an enormous tree, arms wrapped around
      his knees, forehead resting on his arms. His sandy blond hair hides his face.
      His notebook lies on the ground beside him with torn pages scattered nearby.
      A small bird sits on a low branch above him, silent and present, witnessing
      his struggle.

      Noah pressed his face against his knees and let the rain soak through his
      shirt. Every attempt made things worse. He wasn't the hero of this story.
      Maybe he never had been. His notebook pages lay scattered in the mud, filled
      with useless words. The small bird above him didn't sing or speak. It just
      stayed.
