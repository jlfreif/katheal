      Max stands at the Heart Crystal's base, hands pressed against the
      challenge-facet. Through the clear surface, he can see other facets—
      one glowing with stories, one shimmering with colors. His rebuilt
      challenge hovers beside him, cobbled together and imperfect. Cracks
      spread across the crystal. His jaw trembles with doubt.

      Max stood at the Crystal's base, his rebuilt challenge hovering beside
      him. It wasn't perfect. You could see where he'd messed up, where he'd
      had to improvise, where mistakes became solutions. Through the crystal,
      he saw other facets glowing stronger. His hands shook. "This isn't
      good enough," he thought. But it was honest. It was his.

    visual: |
      Max pushes his imperfect challenge toward the Crystal facet. Light
      blazes where they connect. The challenge transforms, its rough edges
      becoming its strength. Cracks seal with musical sounds. Golden threads
      pour from the facet, carrying the lesson: persistence through mistakes
      creates strength that perfection never could.

      "It's not perfect," Max said out loud. "But I didn't quit." He pushed
      the challenge toward the facet. For one terrible moment, nothing happened.
      Then—light exploded where they connected. The challenge's rough edges
      blazed like a constellation. Cracks sealed themselves with sounds like
      victory bells. Golden threads poured from the challenge-facet, stronger
      than any perfect attempt could have made them. Persistence had won.
