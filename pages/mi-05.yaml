      At the base of the cliff, Micah looks up at the challenging climb ahead. The rock face is
      steep and impressive. A slow-moving sloth hangs from a nearby tree branch at ground level,
      barely moving. It speaks in a drowsy, reassuring voice. "Why climb at all? I know a path
      around the cliff. No heights. No fear. Nice and safe, close to the ground." The sloth
      gestures with one slow paw toward a winding trail through the forest that goes around the
      cliff base. It looks easy and inviting—no scary climbing required. Micah's expression shows
      tempted relief. The atmosphere is the seduction of avoiding hard things.

      At the cliff's base, Micah looked up. So high. A sloth hung from a tree, barely moving. "Why climb?" it said slowly. "There's a path around. No heights. No fear. Easy." It pointed to a trail that wound through the forest, staying low and safe. Micah's stomach unclenched. That did sound better.

      Micah follows the sloth's path, which winds through the forest at ground level—safe, easy,
      no climbing required. But the path goes in circles, doubling back on itself, leading nowhere.
      After walking for a while, Micah realizes he's back at the exact same tree where the sloth
      hangs, having made no progress at all. The sloth is still there, unchanged. The cliff still
      rises ahead, unconquered. Golden threads from the tower pulse weakly, waiting. Micah stares
      at the circular path with understanding. Avoiding the challenge doesn't solve anything—it
      just wastes time. His expression shows frustrated realization. The atmosphere is recognizing
      you can't go around hard things, only through them.

      Micah followed the easy path. It wound through trees, staying safe and low. No scary heights. But the path just circled back. He ended up at the same tree, same sloth, same cliff. Going around hadn't worked. The eagle's voice came back: "Face your fear." Micah looked up at the cliff again. There was no way around. Only up.
