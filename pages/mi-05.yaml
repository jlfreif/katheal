# Micah - Spread 5: Bigger World

id: mi-05
spread: 5
node_type: solo
beat: "Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)"
hook: Questionable character offers confident solution, creating doubt about whether to trust them.
payoff: The suggested solution fails spectacularly and obviously wrong.

description: Micah discovers the bigger stakes as he sees the Library failing, then ventures deeper to find more mechanical challenges.

      Micah follows golden threads deeper into the Library's mechanical chambers. More courses stretch
      in every direction, all of them flickering and fading, broken and dark. Ancient gears rust and
      freeze. Pulleys hang limp. In the distance through Library windows, the massive Heart Crystal
      looms—bigger than he realized, with visible cracks spreading like spiderwebs across its surface.
      A flower nearby withers to ash before his eyes. Birds fall silent. The air feels heavy and wrong.
      Micah's expression shows concern—this is serious. The atmosphere conveys genuine stakes—if the
      crystal fails, everything fails. This isn't just a fun challenge anymore. Text in Times New Roman

      Micah followed golden threads deeper into the Library. More mechanical courses stretched in every direction, all broken, all dark. Ancient gears rusted and froze. The Heart Crystal loomed ahead, bigger than he'd realized, cracks spreading like spiderwebs. A flower nearby withered to ash. The air felt wrong. This wasn't just about one course. If the crystal failed, everything failed. Micah's stomach tightened.

    focus: Encountering misleading help
    visual: |
      A smooth-talking raven lands on a mechanism, its feathers gleaming black. "These mechanisms are
      too complex," it says confidently. "But I know the trick. Just move faster. Speed solves
      everything." The raven demonstrates—rushing through a course at breakneck pace, barely touching
      the mechanisms. For a moment it seems to work! But then the mechanisms SHATTER from the force,
      crumbling into broken pieces. The raven tumbles into darkness with a startled cry. Micah jumps
      back from the edge. The golden threads pulse brighter, pointing toward mechanisms that require
      both speed AND stillness. Micah's expression shows shaken realization. There are no shortcuts.
      The atmosphere shows the danger of false solutions. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space

      A raven landed nearby. "These mechanisms are too complex. Just move faster. Speed solves everything." It rushed through a course at breakneck pace. For a moment it worked! Then the mechanisms SHATTERED from the force. The raven fell into darkness. Micah's heart pounded. The golden threads pointed at mechanisms that needed both—speed AND stillness. No shortcuts. Only the real answer.
