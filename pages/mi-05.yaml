beat: "Attempt #3 (creative approach)"

hook: Creative solution shows promise but isn't quite sufficient yet.
payoff: Partial success proves the approach works, suggesting full solution is near.

description: Micah discovers he can move slowly while breathing deliberately, practicing a flowing parkour sequence timed to his breath, and the threads begin to respond positively.

    visual: |
      Micah moves in slow motion through a parkour vault, his body flowing gracefully over
      a fallen log. His eyes are half-closed, focused inward. Visible breath mist forms in
      the air (despite it not being cold) showing his deliberate breathing pattern. Golden
      threads nearby sway gently toward him, following his rhythm. The moth flies alongside
      him, matching his pace.

      Micah breathed in and stepped forward. Breathe out, reach for the log. Breathe in,
      vault over. Each movement stretched slow and intentional, matched to his breath.
      It felt strange—parkour at quarter-speed—but also... right. The threads drifted
      closer, pulsing in time with his breathing. "Okay," he whispered between breaths.
      "We're getting somewhere."

    visual: |
      Micah completes his slow sequence and pauses, breathing steadily. Three golden threads
      have woven themselves into a small, stable pattern near his hands, glowing brighter
      than before. But dozens more still flicker in the distance, too far to reach. His face
      shows both pride and understanding—this works, but there's more to learn. The forest
      ahead seems to pulse with deeper challenges.

      Three threads wove together in his hands, stable and bright. Micah grinned, still
      breathing slowly, deliberately. It worked! But dozens more flickered beyond his reach,
      and the Heart Crystal's glow remained dim. This was progress—breathing while moving,
      moving while breathing—but it wasn't enough yet. He looked toward where the threads
      led, deeper into Kathaél. "One step at a time," he told himself. "One breath at a time."
