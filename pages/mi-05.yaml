      The edge of the still garden, which Micah hasn't entered yet. A hyperactive hummingbird
      zips around him in frantic circles, wings beating impossibly fast, never holding still for
      even a heartbeat. It moves even faster than Micah, chaotic and scattered. Micah watches it
      with recognition—this is him multiplied, constant motion without pause. The hummingbird
      speaks in rapid-fire bursts. The garden beyond looks calm and peaceful, but this hummingbird
      represents Micah's resistance to it. The atmosphere is jittery and unsettled, avoiding the
      real challenge.

      At the garden's edge, a hummingbird blurred around Micah in frantic spirals. "Don't listen to that boring crane! Stillness is wrong! Motion is life! I never stop and I'm fine! See?" It zipped faster and faster, making Micah dizzy just watching.

    visual: |
      The hummingbird attempts to show off its superior approach by moving even faster, but
      suddenly crashes into a tree, falls, and lies stunned and dizzy on the ground, wings
      trembling. It moved so fast for so long it literally couldn't see straight anymore. Micah
      crouches beside it, concerned. The hummingbird's eyes spin in different directions. "Maybe...
      need... tiny pause..." it admits weakly before passing out from exhaustion. Micah looks
      from the collapsed hummingbird to the still garden beyond. The atmosphere shifts from
      avoidance to recognition—he can't run from this lesson forever.

      The hummingbird sped up to prove its point—faster, faster—until WHAM. It crashed into a tree and dropped like a stone. Dizzy. Exhausted. "Maybe... pause... good?" it mumbled before passing out. Micah stared at the tiny bird. That would be him if he never learned to stop. He turned toward the still garden. Time to face it.
