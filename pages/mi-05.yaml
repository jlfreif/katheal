      Micah follows golden threads deeper into Kathaél's forest. More platform courses stretch
      in every direction, all of them flickering and fading, broken and dark. In the distance,
      the massive Heart Crystal looms—bigger than he realized, with visible cracks spreading like
      spiderwebs across its surface. A flower nearby withers to ash before his eyes. Birds fall
      silent. The air feels heavy and wrong. Micah's expression shows concern—this is serious.
      The atmosphere conveys genuine stakes—if the crystal fails, everything fails. This isn't
      just a fun challenge anymore.

      Micah followed golden threads deeper into Kathaél. More courses stretched in every direction, all broken, all dark. The Heart Crystal loomed ahead, bigger than he'd realized, cracks spreading like spiderwebs. A flower nearby withered to ash. The air felt wrong. This wasn't just about one course. If the crystal failed, everything failed. Micah's stomach tightened.

    focus: Encountering Noah
    visual: |
      Micah's cousin Noah steps out from behind a tree—sandy hair messy, looking exhausted but
      determined. Both boys stare at each other in surprise and recognition. "Noah?! What are
      YOU doing here?" Noah gestures at the broken platforms around them, equally surprised to
      see Micah. They're both in Kathaél, both trying to fix things. Family reunion in an
      impossible magical forest. In the background, more broken courses flicker. Micah's expression
      shows surprise mixed with relief—he's not alone. Noah looks tired but hopeful. The
      atmosphere shows connection and shared purpose.

      "Micah?" Another familiar voice. His cousin Noah stepped out from behind a tree, sandy hair messy, looking exhausted. "Noah?! Dude, what are you doing here?" Noah gestured at the broken platforms. "Trying to save this place. It's harder than it looks." Micah laughed. "Tell me about it. I keep getting reset." They compared notes. Noah had noticed something. "The platforms don't just move. They react to how you move."
