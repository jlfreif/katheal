      Micah stands at the edge of a grove where everything spins and whirls in constant motion.
      Threads twist through the air in wild spirals. Leaves blow perpetually in circles. Even
      the ground seems to vibrate with frenetic energy. The scene captures Micah mid-step,
      entering this chaos. His expression shows excitement rather than concern because this
      energy matches his own. Flowers bloom and wilt in rapid succession. The whole scene
      feels dizzying and unstable. Wind whips his hair in multiple directions.

      Micah burst into a grove where everything moved at once. Wind spun in circles. Threads
      whipped through the air in frantic spirals. Nothing held still. Finally, a place that
      matched how he felt inside! He grinned and dove in, his body immediately caught up in
      the whirlwind. This felt right. This felt like home.

    focus: Encountering misleading help

    visual: |
      A brilliant hummingbird with iridescent feathers hovers before Micah's face, wings
      beating so fast they're just a blur. The bird darts around Micah in dizzying circles,
      never still for a moment. Micah tries to keep up, spinning to follow the bird's
      movement. Behind them, threads tangle worse with every motion, pulling tighter into
      impossible knots. The hummingbird's energy is infectious but destructive. Micah's
      expression shows strain as he tries to match the bird's speed. Everything is becoming
      more chaotic.

      A hummingbird zipped past his ear. "Faster! Faster! That's how you fix everything!"
      It darted in wild patterns, never pausing. Micah spun to follow, running in circles,
      jumping, reaching. The threads whipped faster, tangling into hard knots. "More speed!"
      chirped the bird. But Micah's chest felt tight. His breath came in gasps. Something was very, very wrong.
