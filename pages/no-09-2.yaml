      As Noah accepts his fears as teachers, the pool's water begins to clear. The shadows don't
      disappear—instead they transform into pathways, swirling beneath the surface like a map made
      of light and dark together. Noah's eyes widen with sudden understanding. He holds up the
      Cartographer's Compass and looks at it really seeing it for the first time. The needle points
      not outward but at his own heart—it always has.

      The pool showed Noah a revelation: every path he'd walked—scary caves, high cliffs, uncertain
      forks—had built something inside him. The compass never pointed to places. It pointed to who
      he needed to become.

      Noah stands at the pool's edge, holding the compass with both hands, but no longer needing it
      to tell him what to do. His posture radiates quiet confidence. Around him, the grove glows—
      not magically, but with the light of his own clarity. He pulls out the feather charm, holds
      it and the compass together. They glow in harmony. Behind him, a path appears that he hadn't
      seen before—leading to the final truth. He smiles, ready.

      Noah laughed—surprised and relieved and joyful all at once. "You were showing me my own
      courage," he said to the compass. Its needle steadied, pointing at the path he'd create
      next. And for the first time, Noah knew exactly what to do.
