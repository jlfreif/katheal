      Elise stands alone in the performance hall, the frozen dancers still waiting around her.
      Evening light streams through windows, casting long shadows. She faces the incomplete
      choreography, the final leap still undone. Her hands rest over her heart as she takes a
      deep breath, eyes closed, gathering herself. When she opens her eyes, they show quiet
      determination. She moves into position for the final sequence, not perfectly poised but
      genuinely ready. Her whole posture shifts from careful control to centered presence. The
      atmosphere is hushed and sacred, a moment of choosing courage.

      Elise stood before the unfinished dance, remembering why she'd started. Not to be perfect.
      Not to impress anyone. But to express what lived inside her—the movement, the music, the
      story her body wanted to tell. That mattered more than getting it exactly right. She placed
      her hand over her heart, feeling it beat steady and strong. Then she moved into position,
      ready to leap without knowing how she'd land.

    visual: |
      Elise mid-leap, body extended in a graceful arc, face showing joy and freedom rather than
      fear. Golden threads shimmer into visibility throughout the hall, flowing through the air
      like ribbons of light, connecting her to the dancers and to something far beyond. The
      frozen performers burst into motion around her, completing their dances with newfound life.
      A warm glow surrounds her as she flies through the air. The threads pulse with light that
      seems to come from a distant source, as if someone far away is being brave at the same
      moment. Her expression is wonder mixed with understanding. The hall fills with golden
      radiance and movement.

      Elise leaped. Not perfectly, but fully, committing to the movement with her whole self.
      Golden threads blazed through the hall, connecting her leap to something distant—someone
      else choosing courage at the exact same moment. She felt their bravery strengthen hers,
      felt her determination flow back to them. The dancers woke completely, moving with joyful
      freedom. The finale wasn't about perfect technique. It was about showing up, being present,
      expressing truth. That was the magic Kathaél needed.
