      Elise stands alone in the performance hall, the frozen dancers still waiting around her.
      Evening light streams through windows, casting long shadows. She faces the incomplete
      choreography, the final leap still undone. Her hands rest over her heart as she takes a
      deep breath, eyes closed, gathering herself. When she opens her eyes, they show quiet
      determination. She moves into position for the final sequence, not perfectly poised but
      genuinely ready. Her whole posture shifts from careful control to centered presence. The
      atmosphere is hushed and sacred, a moment of choosing courage.

      Elise walked back to the performance hall, each step heavy. She remembered why she danced. Not to be perfect. To tell the story her body wanted to tell. "I can do this," she said to the empty stage. She placed her hand over her heart, feeling it beat. Then she moved into position, ready.

    visual: |
      Elise mid-leap, body extended in a graceful arc, face showing joy and freedom rather than
      fear. Golden threads shimmer into visibility throughout the hall, flowing through the air
      like ribbons of light, connecting her to the dancers and to something far beyond. The
      frozen performers burst into motion around her, completing their dances with newfound life.
      A warm glow surrounds her as she flies through the air. The threads pulse with light that
      seems to come from a distant source, as if someone far away is being brave at the same
      moment. Her expression is wonder mixed with understanding. The hall fills with golden
      radiance and movement.

      Elise leaped. Not perfectly. Fully, with her whole self. Golden threads blazed through the hall, connecting everything. Someone far away was being brave at the exact same moment. She felt their courage strengthen hers. "We're doing this together," she breathed. The dancers woke completely, moving with joy. The finale wasn't about perfect. It was about true.
