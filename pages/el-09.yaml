      Elise stands at the edge of the musical notes chamber, the crumbling floor ahead of her. She
      takes a deep breath, hands over her heart, feeling it beat. She remembers what the Library
      taught her—technique plus joy. She remembers defeating the guardian. She remembers every path
      she's already conquered. Her legs still shake with exhaustion but her expression shows quiet
      determination. She moves into starting position—not rigid and perfect, but centered and ready.
      One foot forward. Arms loose. A small smile touches her lips. The impossible pattern waits,
      notes glowing above the pedestal. Evening light streams through Library windows. The atmosphere
      is hushed, a moment of choosing courage.

      Elise flying through the impossible sequence in the chamber. Triple spin mid-leap—she adds a
      laugh. Rapid footwork—she adds joy. Landing on crumbling sections—she jumps with her whole
      heart, not just technique. The floor blazes bright beneath her, healing as she dances. Gaps
      close. The crumbling stops. She moves like never before—powerful technique mixed with pure
      freedom. The musical notes pedestal erupts in golden light. Golden threads shimmer into
      visibility, flowing through the Library, connecting her pedestal to the other four around the
      Heart Crystal. The threads pulse with light from distant sources—others are being brave at
      the exact same moment. Her expression shows wonder mixed with joy. The pedestal sings in
      harmony with something far beyond.

The chamber blazed bright, healing beneath her feet. She moved like never before. Technique plus joy. Powerful and free. The pedestal erupted in golden light. Golden threads connected to the other pedestals across the Library. Others were being brave at the exact same moment. She felt their courage strengthen hers. "Together," she breathed. The Heart Crystal pulsed brighter, calling them all forward.
