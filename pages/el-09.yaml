    visual: |
      Elise kneels beside a single glowing flower in the grey meadow, her
      earlier work still holding its color. Her watercolor set lies open
      beside her, but she's not painting—she's simply looking at the one
      flower she helped. Her expression shifts from despair to something
      softer. One flower mattered.

      Through her tears, Elise saw one flower still glowing. Just one, from
      her earlier work, holding its color against all the grey. It was tiny.
      It was almost nothing. But it was real. She picked up her watercolor
      set. If one flower could matter, then the next one could too.

    focus: Feeling the connection

    visual: |
      Golden threads shimmer into visibility across the meadow, pulsing
      with warm light. Elise looks up, wonder on her face, as she feels
      something like encouragement wash over her. Near her feet, a flower
      begins to restore its color without her touching it. The grey seems
      less heavy.

      Golden light rippled through the air, threads she'd never seen before,
      connecting the whole meadow. Elise felt warmth spread through her chest,
      like someone somewhere was choosing the same courage she was. A flower
      near her feet began to glow—without her even touching it. She wasn't
      doing this alone.
