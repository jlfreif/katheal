description: After her moment with Noah at the cliff, Elise realizes that her gentle voice has already been powerful—in her art, her gifts, her attention—and returns to the Garden of Whispers ready to speak her truth.

visual: |
  Elise arrives at the Garden of Whispers as stars begin to appear overhead. The garden seems
  to have been waiting—flowers all turned toward the center pool, expectant. The paperbird
  hovers weakly above the water, its fading form reflected in the still surface. Elise kneels
  at the pool's edge, takes a deep breath, and looks at the paperbird with clear, gentle eyes.
  She knows what to say now. She knows her voice matters. The garden holds its breath in
  anticipation.

  As Elise wove the charm for Noah, she remembered: her quiet words had calmed him. Her gentle
  gifts had mattered. The sky-moths glowed brighter near her hands. Maybe her voice didn't need
  to be loud to be powerful. Elise understood now: her voice had always had power—in her art,
  her gifts, her careful noticing. She didn't need to be loud. She just needed to be true. The
  paperbird needed to hear her speak what she'd always known. Elise walked back to the garden
  with new purpose. She wasn't different—she was just finally seeing herself clearly. Her quiet
  voice had always mattered. Now she just needed to use it. The garden waited. The paperbird
  waited. Elise took a breath and finally understood: the paperbird's story was her story. And
  she was ready to speak it.
