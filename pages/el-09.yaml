      Elise stands at the edge of the impossible rhythm-path, the crumbling sections ahead of her.
      She takes a deep breath, hands over her heart, feeling it beat. She remembers what Mona
      showed her—technique plus joy. She remembers defeating the golem. She remembers every path
      she's already conquered. Her legs still shake with exhaustion but her expression shows quiet
      determination. She moves into starting position—not rigid and perfect, but centered and ready.
      One foot forward. Arms loose. A small smile touches her lips. The path waits, impossible
      footprints glowing. Evening light casts long shadows. The atmosphere is hushed, a moment of
      choosing courage.

      Elise flying through the impossible sequence. Triple spin mid-leap—she adds a laugh. Rapid
      footwork—she adds joy. Landing on crumbling sections—she jumps with her whole heart, not
      just technique. The path blazes bright beneath her, healing as she dances. Gaps close. The
      crumbling stops. She moves like never before—powerful technique mixed with pure freedom.
      Golden threads shimmer into visibility, flowing through the air, connecting her to all the
      paths in Kathaél and to something far beyond. A warm glow surrounds her as she flies. The
      threads pulse with light from a distant source—someone far away is being brave at the exact
      same moment. Her expression shows wonder mixed with joy. The path leads to the Heart Crystal,
      glowing brighter now.
