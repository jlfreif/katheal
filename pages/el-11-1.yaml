      Elise walks through the Whispering Woods as morning light filters through the canopy. The
      paperbird flies beside her—fully vibrant now, its wings flashing all the colors of emotion
      and story: joy-gold, peace-blue, courage-crimson, love-rose. Other paperbirds escort them,
      creating a procession of color and light. Elise moves with quiet confidence, her sketchbook
      clutched to her chest. She's different—not louder, but more sure. The woods recognize her
      transformation, flowers blooming in her wake.

      Elise walked home through the woods that had seemed so scary before. But now they felt like
      friends, celebrating her journey. Her paperbird sang beside her—fully alive, fully vibrant,
      fully seen.

      As Elise reaches the forest edge, the Weaver of Words appears one last time, emerging from
      behind an ancient tree. It approaches Elise gently and presents her with a gift: a small
      journal bound in starlight-thread. "For the quiet observer who learned to speak," the Weaver
      says. "Your voice matters. May you always remember." Elise accepts it with shy pride, holding
      both the journal and her restored paperbird. The Weaver's many eyes show genuine joy at her
      transformation.

      The Weaver gave Elise a gift: a journal made of starlight. "Write your observations, speak
      your truths," it said gently. "The world needs voices like yours—gentle but brave, quiet but
      clear." Elise nodded, understanding finally: her voice mattered.
