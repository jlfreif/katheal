id: mx-04
spread: 4
node_type: solo
beat: "Attempt #2: Ask the expert / strategic approach"

hook: Character tries a more thoughtful, analytical approach.
payoff: Even the strategic approach fails because the challenge adapts.

description: Max studies the course more carefully, looking for patterns in the timing, but discovers the course actively adapts and learns.

      Max circles the obstacle course floating near the pedestal, studying it from different angles. He
      pulls out his phone, taking notes and recording patterns. He's analyzing the way handholds rotate—
      three clicks left, two clicks right, one click left. There's a rhythm to it. His expression is
      focused and thoughtful—this is Max using his puzzle-solving brain combined with his athletic sense
      of timing. He watches the obstacles move in sequence. Around him, the Library hums with books and
      scrolls. He can time this. Map the pattern. The fox watches with interest from among the books.
      The atmosphere is analytical, strategic. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max circled the course, studying it. There had to be a pattern. He was good at patterns. The handholds rotated in sequence—three clicks left, two clicks right, one click left. He could time it. He pulled out his phone, started recording notes. Math this out. Solve the puzzle before trying the physical challenge.

      Max runs the course again, clearly having made it further than before—he's past the rotating wall
      using his timing strategy. Yes! But then the course shifts. New obstacles appear that weren't there
      before. The balance beam splits into three paths. The rope swing starts moving on its own. Around
      him in the Library, books flutter with interest. Max's expression shows surprise and frustration—
      "Oh, come ON!" The course isn't just difficult, it's actively adaptive. It learns from his attempts
      and changes. The fox's tail swishes. The golden threads connecting to the pedestal pulse with new
      complexity. The atmosphere is one of escalating challenge. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white

      Max ran the course again, timing every move. He made it past the rotating wall. Yes! Then the course shifted. New obstacles appeared. The balance beam split into three paths. The rope swing moved. "Oh, come ON!" Max shouted. The course wasn't just hard. It was adaptive. It learned. The fox's tail swished once. This would take more than timing.
