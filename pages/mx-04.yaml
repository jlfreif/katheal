      The mechanical owl perched on a gear-shaped tree branch, its brass body intricate and
      beautiful. Max stands below looking up, notebook in hand, ready to take notes. Around them,
      the clearing of broken machines waits quietly. The owl's crystal eyes swivel to focus on
      Max, mechanisms clicking softly. Its wings fold and unfold in mechanical rhythm. Max's
      posture shows respect and eagerness to learn. The atmosphere is contemplative, a moment of
      teaching and listening.

      "How do I fix them?" Max asked the mechanical owl, pencil ready to write down formulas.
      The owl's gears whirred thoughtfully. "You can't fix magic with measurements, young inventor.
      Kathaél's mechanisms need something calculations can't provide—playful experimentation,
      joyful curiosity, the courage to try things just to see what happens." Max frowned. That
      sounded messy. Inefficient. "Where do I learn that?"

    visual: |
      The owl spreads its mechanical wings, pointing toward a wild, overgrown part of the forest
      where plants grow in impossible spirals and colors shift unexpectedly. No straight lines,
      no clear patterns, no predictable outcomes. Max stares at it with visible apprehension,
      clutching his notebook like a safety blanket. The owl's expression (despite being mechanical)
      somehow conveys both kindness and challenge. The wild forest beckons, beautiful but chaotic.
      The organized clearing behind Max suddenly feels very safe and comfortable. The atmosphere
      shifts to anticipation mixed with worry.

      The owl pointed one brass wing toward the wild forest where nothing followed rules. "There.
      Where you can't measure or predict. Where experimenting matters more than being right." Max
      looked at the chaotic tangle of impossible plants and shifting colors. His analytical brain
      recoiled. But the broken deer in his hands reminded him that his way hadn't worked. He
      took a breath. "Okay. I'll try it your way." Even if it terrified him.
