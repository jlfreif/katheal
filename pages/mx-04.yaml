    focus: Seeking guidance

    visual: |
      Max jogs through the forest following golden threads, notebook tucked
      under his arm filled with technique notes. The threads lead him toward
      a training ground where multiple paths converge. He scans the area
      with competitive focus, looking for someone who might have answers.
      His athletic stride shows confidence despite his earlier failures.

      Max followed the strongest threads, hoping they'd lead to someone who
      knew the right technique. He'd been approaching it wrong, clearly.
      There must be a system, a method, a proper way to fix these challenges.
      The threads led him to a training ground where paths crossed. "Someone
      here has to know how this works."

    focus: Receiving direction with warning

    visual: |
      Max stands at a crossroads where training paths meet. Golden threads
      pulse and point toward unfamiliar territory ahead—a place where the
      challenges look harder, weirder, nothing like the sports courses he
      knows. A deer watches from the edge, its expression warning. Max
      swallows but sets his jaw determinedly.

      The threads pulsed and pointed ahead, toward training grounds that looked
      nothing like basketball courts or track fields. Obstacles twisted in
      impossible shapes, challenges that made no sense. A deer met his eyes,
      and Max understood the message: this would be harder than anything he'd
      tried. "Okay," Max said, rolling his shoulders. "I can handle hard."
