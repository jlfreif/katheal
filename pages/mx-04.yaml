# Max - Spread 4: Attempt #2
# Ask the expert / strategic approach

id: mx-04
spread: 4
node_type: solo
beat: "Attempt #2: Ask the expert / strategic approach"

hook: Character tries a more thoughtful, analytical approach.
payoff: Even the strategic approach fails because the challenge adapts.

description: Max studies the sequences more carefully, looking for meta-patterns, but discovers the Library actively adapts and learns.

      Max circles the mathematical sequences, studying them from different angles in the Library. He
      pulls out his phone, taking notes and recording patterns. He's analyzing the way sequences change
      and transform. His expression is focused and thoughtful—this is Max using his puzzle-solving
      brain at full power. Around him we can see the meta-patterns: how sequences relate to each other,
      how they transform in rhythm. Max is treating this like a multi-layered mathematical problem to
      solve. The fox watches with interest. Books hover nearby. The atmosphere is analytical, strategic.

      Max circled the sequences, studying them from every angle. There had to be a meta-pattern. He was good at this. The way sequences transformed—there was a rhythm to it. He could map it. He pulled out his phone, started recording notes. Math this out.

      Max is working on sequences again, clearly having made it further than before—he's past several
      complex patterns. But now the Library is actively changing around him. New sequences appear that
      he's never seen. Variables shift into Greek letters, then symbols he doesn't recognize. The
      patterns branch into multiple possibilities simultaneously. Max's expression shows surprise and
      frustration—"Oh, come ON!" The sequences aren't just difficult, they're actively adaptive. They
      learn. The fox's tail swishes. The golden threads pulse with new complexity. The atmosphere is
      one of escalating challenge. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max worked the sequences again, mapping every transformation. He made it past the complex patterns. Yes! Then the Library shifted. New sequences appeared he'd never seen. Variables changed to symbols he didn't recognize. Patterns branched into simultaneous possibilities. "Oh, come ON!" The sequences weren't just hard. They were adaptive. They learned.
