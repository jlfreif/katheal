# Ask the expert / strategic approach

id: mx-04
spread: 4
node_type: solo
beat: "Attempt #2: Ask the expert / strategic approach"

hook: Character tries a more thoughtful, analytical approach.
payoff: Even the strategic approach fails because the challenge adapts.

description: Max studies the course, looking for patterns and timing, but discovers the course actively adapts and learns.

      Max circles the obstacle course, studying it carefully. He pulls out his phone, taking
      notes or recording observations. He's analyzing the rotating handholds, watching their
      pattern. His expression is focused and thoughtful - this is Max using his puzzle-solving
      brain. Around him we can see the course's patterns: handholds rotating in sequence, beams
      moving in rhythm. Max is treating this like a math problem to solve. The fox watches with
      interest. The atmosphere is analytical, strategic. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in

      Max circled the course, studying it. There had to be a pattern. He was good at patterns. The handholds rotated in sequence—three clicks left, two clicks right, one click left. He could time it. He pulled out his phone, started recording notes. Math this out.

      Max is on the course again, clearly having made it further than before - he's past the
      rotating wall section. But now the course is actively changing around him. The balance beam
      splits into three paths before his eyes. The rope swing shifts position. New obstacles
      appear. Max's expression shows surprise and frustration - "Oh, come ON!" The course isn't
      just difficult, it's actively adaptive. The fox's tail swishes. The golden threads pulse
      with new complexity. The atmosphere is one of escalating challenge. Text in Times New Roman

      Max ran the course again, timing every move. He made it past the rotating wall. Yes! Then the course shifted. New obstacles appeared. The balance beam split into three paths. The rope swing moved. "Oh, come ON!" The course wasn't just hard. It was adaptive. It learned.
