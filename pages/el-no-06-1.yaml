      The Singing Stones form a perfect spiral of seven tall pillars, each made of iridescent
      crystal that shifts between purple, blue, and silver. They hum with ethereal music—tones
      that seem to form words almost, but not quite. Noah bursts into the clearing from the east,
      breathing hard, compass glowing. At the exact same moment, Ellie appears from the west,
      sketchbook in hand, drawn by the haunting melody. They stop, surprised to see each other.
      The stones' music swells.

      Noah and Ellie arrived at the same heartbeat, from opposite sides of the spiral.
      The Singing Stones grew louder, as if welcoming them both. "You hear it too?" Noah gasped.

      The siblings stand facing the stones. A riddle appears to form in the air itself, made of
      golden light that pulses with the music: "The path ahead opens when two see what one alone
      cannot." Noah hears musical tones that form a map pattern—stone by stone, a sequence. Ellie
      hears different tones that form a rhythm pattern—tap, pause, tap-tap. They look at each
      other, confused but beginning to understand. The stones wait, glowing expectantly.

      The stones sang their riddle in light and sound. Noah heard patterns like a map. Ellie heard
      rhythms like a heartbeat. "I think," Noah said slowly, "we need both."
