      Back cover design with soft watercolor background in vibrant pinks, warm creams,
      and honey golds with jewel tone accents. Golden threads create a bold, artistic
      border around the edges, weaving into paint strokes, dance ribbons, and creative
      symbols. A small facet of the Heart Crystal glows softly in the upper corner,
      refracting rainbow colors. The golden threads form decorative frames for the text
      areas. At the bottom, tiny silhouettes of six children (representing all the
      characters) stand together, connected by shimmering golden threads. The overall
      atmosphere is bold, creative, and inviting, with delicate ink linework adding
      detail to the artistic elements. Space in the center is left clear for text placement.
