      The vibrant paperbirds form a gentle escort, flying in a protective circle around the fading
      one and Elise. They guide her deeper into the woods, their colors lighting the way like
      living lanterns. Elise follows, sketching occasionally despite walking—she's learning to
      capture motion, fleeting beauty. The paperbirds' song creates a harmony that sounds almost
      like words: "voice... voice... voice..." Elise doesn't understand yet, but she listens
      carefully, trying to decode the message.

      The paperbirds sang as they flew, their voices weaving a puzzle Elise couldn't quite solve.
      "Voice, voice, voice," they seemed to say. What did it mean? She followed, hoping to understand.

      The paperbirds stop at a three-way fork in the path, where ancient standing stones mark
      each direction. The healthy paperbirds circle in confusion—they don't know which way to go.
      The fading paperbird drifts weakly, barely able to fly. Elise stands at the crossroads,
      anxious but thinking. Each stone has symbols carved in it, and she recognizes them from
      the writing on the paperbird's wings. She needs to choose a path, but which one? Her hands
      tremble slightly as she examines the stones, detail by detail.

      Three paths, three choices. The paperbirds couldn't choose—they needed someone who could
      read the stones, notice the details. Elise felt scared but studied each symbol carefully.
      She had to get this right.
