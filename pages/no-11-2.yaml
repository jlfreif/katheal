      Noah steps out of the Whispering Woods into the golden meadow where his journey began. Ellie
      waits there, sitting in the grass surrounded by her sketches of the forest—paperbirds, singing
      stones, the paths they shared. She looks up and sees Noah, and her face lights up. She jumps
      to her feet. They run to meet each other in the middle of the meadow, embracing. The afternoon
      sun makes everything glow.

      "You found it!" Ellie called, running to him. Noah hugged her tight. "I found me," he said.
      "And I couldn't have done it without you. Your feather charm—it saved me when I almost gave up."

      Noah and Ellie sit together in the meadow, heads bent over her sketchbook. Noah pulls out
      Bramblebeard's acorn—still glowing faintly—and places it gently in Ellie's palm. Her eyes
      widen with wonder. "It's magic," she breathes. Noah smiles. "It's possibility. Want to plant
      it together?" Behind them, the Whispering Woods rustle with approval. New adventures await,
      but for now, they're home.

      Ellie studied the glowing acorn, then looked at Noah with that familiar spark. "What happens
      if we plant it?" Noah grinned, feeling the answer inside him. "We find out. Together." The
      woods whispered yes.
