    focus: Returning to ordinary world

    visual: |
      Maya sits cross-legged on her bedroom floor in the same position as
      the opening, surrounded by paint supplies. But now the magical paint
      pot from Kathaél sits among her ordinary paints, glowing softly. Her
      pink-streaked hair catches light the same way, but her posture radiates
      confidence. The music plays. She's painting with bold joyful energy.

      Maya's bedroom looked the same: afternoon light, paint everywhere, music
      playing softly. But she didn't feel the same. She picked up her brush
      and opened the magical paint pot. The colors inside shifted and glowed,
      responding to her boldness. "Okay," she said to her blank paper. "Let's
      make something wild and true."

    focus: Transformed by the journey

    visual: |
      Maya paints with fierce joy—bold strokes, mixed colors, energy flying
      off the page. The painting shows dancers in her own style: wild, authentic,
      uniquely Maya. Parts of it glow with golden light. Her other paintings
      on the walls seem brighter. Through the window, a golden thread shimmers.
      The colorful butterfly from Kathaél rests on the windowsill, watching.

      Maya painted like herself—big bold strokes, colors that clashed and sang,
      energy that couldn't be contained. Not perfect. Not proper. Just true.
      Parts of her painting glowed with golden light, the same light she'd
      brought to Kathaél. Outside her window, a golden thread danced in Madrid
      sunlight. The butterfly from the meadow sat on her sill, wings brilliant.
      Maya grinned. "Being yourself," she said, "is the best adventure."
