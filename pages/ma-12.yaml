      Maya's room in Madrid, the same space as the opening. Golden threads fade from view as the
      Library closes behind her. Her old paintings still cover the walls—the ones with quick judgments
      written on them. Maya stands before her easel, the golden wristband glowing softly on her wrist.
      She looks at her old work with new eyes. The "boring tree" painting actually has beautiful
      complexity in the bark she never noticed before. The "silly clouds" have intricate patterns. The
      room looks the same but she sees it completely differently now. Her expression shows gentle
      wisdom. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Maya stood in her room looking at her old paintings. "Boring tree." "Silly clouds." She saw them now—really saw. The tree's bark held patterns she'd missed. The clouds shaped stories. She'd been so quick to judge. The wristband from the Library pulsed warm on her wrist.

      Maya sits before a new canvas, painting slowly and carefully. She captures not just the surface
      but hints of the depth beneath—the way light reveals layers, the way simple things hold
      complexity, the way first impressions can be both true and incomplete. The wristband glows beside
      her easel. Faint golden threads appear in her painting, showing the hidden connections beneath
      surface appearances. She pauses, really looking at her work, seeing what's there. Words float
      faintly in the air around her—riddles from the Library, echoes of her pedestal. Her expression
      shows patient joy. The scene celebrates seeing truly. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space
      at bottom.

      Maya painted slowly now. She looked deeper. Saw the layers beneath. Surfaces still mattered, but they weren't everything. The wristband glowed. Golden threads appeared in her painting, showing what lay beneath. Riddles whispered in her mind—surface and depth, both true. "This is my courage," she whispered. "Seeing beyond what things seem to be. Looking for what's really there."
