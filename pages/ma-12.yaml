      Maya's room in Madrid, the same space as the opening. Her easel holds the painting she
      was working on before Kathaél. Maya stands before it with the crystal paint pot in hand,
      looking at her previous work with new eyes. The room looks the same but she sees it
      differently. Her expression shows confident self-knowledge. The atmosphere is familiar but
      transformed by complete self-acceptance.

      Maya stood in her room, looking at the painting from before. She'd been holding back a little, afraid her colors might be too much. The crystal paint pot pulsed at her belt. She wasn't afraid anymore. She picked up her brush.

      Maya paints with complete freedom and joy, adding wild, unexpected colors to her canvas—
      shades that shouldn't work together but do, patterns that seem chaotic but create perfect
      harmony. The crystal paint pot glows brilliantly. On the canvas, faint golden threads appear
      in the paint, Kathaél's magic woven through her art. The pink streak in her hair blazes
      bright. She laughs as she paints, dancing while she works, adding purple polka dots just
      because she wants to. Small sparkles of color drift through her room. Her whole being
      radiates bold authenticity. The scene feels triumphant—magic lived through complete self-
      expression.

      Maya painted without fear. Colors her art teacher would hate, patterns that broke every rule. The crystal paint pot glowed. Golden threads wove through her work. She grinned, adding orange just because it made her happy. "This is my courage. Being exactly who I am, loud and bright and unafraid."
