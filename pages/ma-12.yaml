      Maya's room in Madrid, the same space as the opening. Her old paintings still cover the
      walls—the ones with quick judgments written on them. Maya stands before her easel holding
      the crystal from Kathaél, looking at her old work with new eyes. The "boring tree" painting
      actually has beautiful complexity in the bark she never noticed. The "silly clouds" have
      intricate patterns. The room looks the same but she sees it completely differently now.
      Her expression shows gentle wisdom.

      Maya stood in her room looking at her old paintings. "Boring tree." "Silly clouds." She saw them now—really saw. The tree's bark held patterns she'd missed. The clouds shaped stories. She'd been so quick to judge. The crystal from Kathaél pulsed warm in her hand.

      Maya sits before a new canvas, painting slowly and carefully. She captures not just the
      surface but hints of the depth beneath—the way light reveals layers, the way simple things
      hold complexity, the way first impressions can be both true and incomplete. The crystal
      glows beside her easel. Faint golden threads appear in her painting, showing the hidden
      connections beneath surface appearances. She pauses, really looking at her work, seeing
      what's there. Her expression shows patient joy. The scene celebrates seeing truly.

      Maya painted slowly now. She looked deeper. Saw the layers beneath. Surfaces still mattered, but they weren't everything. The crystal glowed. Golden threads appeared in her painting, showing what lay beneath. "This is my courage," she whispered. "Seeing beyond what things seem to be. Looking for what's really there."
