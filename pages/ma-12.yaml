      Maya's room in Madrid, the same space as the opening. Golden threads fade from view as the
      Library closes behind her. Her old paintings still cover the walls—the ones painted quickly in
      ten minutes. Maya stands before her easel, the golden wristband glowing softly on her wrist.
      She looks at her old work with new eyes. They're skillful, yes, but they feel hollow. Surface-level.
      They were made fast without presence or emotional truth. The room looks the same but she understands

      Maya stood in her room looking at her old paintings. Quick sketches. They were skillful but without truth and deep feeling. The wristband from the Library pulsed warm on her wrist. She understood now what was missing.

      Maya sits before a new canvas, painting slowly and carefully. She's present with each brushstroke,
      honest with each color choice, patient with each detail. The painting—maybe a portrait or a
      landscape—doesn't literally move like the Library paintings did, but it FEELS alive. It holds
      depth, emotion, truth. The wristband glows beside her easel. Faint golden threads appear in her
      painting, suggesting the life breathing beneath the surface. She pauses, really looking at her
      work, being present with it. Living canvases whisper in her memory—echoes of her pedestal, reminders
      that art given time and presence truly lives. Her expression shows patient joy. The scene celebrates
      creating with honesty.

      Maya painted slowly now. Present with each brushstroke. Honest with each color. Patient with each detail. The painting didn't move like in the Library, but it FELT alive. Held truth. The wristband glowed. Golden threads whispered in the paint. Living canvases echoed in her memory—time, presence, honesty. "This is my courage," she whispered. "Creating art that's truly alive. Painting what's really there, inside and out."
