      The top of the big slide, now fully alive and glowing with golden light. The whole playground
      visible below, all toys working, all children playing joyfully. Mona stands at the top, one
      hand on the slide, receiving a gift from Kathaél—a small golden star that fits perfectly
      in her toddler hand, warm and glowing, pulsing with the rhythm of trying-new-things courage.
      Her bunny is tucked safely under one arm. Her expression shows proud happiness and
      accomplishment. The slide gleams, ready for its first rider. A pathway home shimmers below,
      made of soft golden light. The atmosphere celebrates small-but-mighty bravery.

      Mona sliding down the enormous twisty slide, bunny clutched in one arm, golden star in her
      other hand, pure joy on her face. Her hair flies back, the slide spirals and swoops, golden
      light trails behind her like a comet. At the bottom, the path home waits. Other children
      cheer. The slide sparkles with life. Her expression shows absolute delight—the thing that
      was scary is now pure fun. The atmosphere is triumphant and joyful, celebrating courage
      rewarded with joy.

      Mona slid down laughing. The scary slide was the best slide! At the bottom she waved goodbye. The golden star glowed in her hand.
