      The Heart Crystal blazes with brilliant light, every color imaginable
      refracting through its facets. Mona stands at its base, her glowing block
      now permanently bright, pulsing in rhythm with the Crystal. Around her,
      Kathaél is transformed—flowers in full bloom, butterflies of every color,
      the musical flower-bells singing in harmony. Her creature friends gather
      close. Between Mona's hands appears a new toy—a soft, glowing star that
      pulses warmly.

      The Crystal sang like all the best playground sounds together—laughter
      and music and joy! Mona's block pulsed with it, and suddenly something
      new appeared in her hands. A soft star-toy, squishy and warm, glowing
      gentle-bright. The butterfly landed on it. "For when trying feels scary,"
      it whispered. "It remembers that you were brave." The bunny nuzzled her
      cheek. The turtle smiled. "You showed us all how, little teacher."

    visual: |
      Mona walks along a glowing path back toward home, the star-toy clutched
      against her chest. The path is lined with blooming flowers and happy
      creatures waving goodbye. Her other new friends—the older children from
      the convergence—wave from a distance. Everything is bright and alive now,
      full of color and possibility. Mona looks back once, smiling, then forward
      toward the shimmer that leads to Gymboree.

      Mona toddled along the bright path, her star-toy warm against her heart.
      All of Kathaél sparkled now—every flower, every thread, every story found
      its courage to try again. She waved at the butterfly doing loop-de-loops,
      at the bunny hopping happy circles, at the flower-bells chiming their
      songs. The other children called goodbye, and Mona called back: "Try
      together!" The path home shimmered ahead, and she was ready.
