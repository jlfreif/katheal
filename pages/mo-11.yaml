      Mona stands before the massive Heart Crystal, which now blazes with light from all its
      facets. Golden threads flow from it in all directions like rivers of sunshine, completely
      untangled and vibrant. The entire forest celebrates around her: birds sing, flowers bloom
      instantly, trees shimmer with renewed life. A wise deer approaches and bows its head,
      placing a single glowing thread in Mona's small palm. The thread wraps gently around her
      wrist like a bracelet, pulsing with warm light. Her face shows pure joy and pride.

      The Heart Crystal sang with light. Every thread glowed strong and free, flowing through
      Kathaél like rivers of joy. Mona had done it. Not by being big or strong, but by being
      brave enough to try new things without fear. A deer lowered its head, offering her a
      golden thread. "A gift," it said gently. "To remember that trying is its own kind of magic."

    focus: Beginning the return

    visual: |
      Mona walks back through the glowing forest toward the shimmering portal she first came
      through, visible between the trees ahead. She looks back over her shoulder at the
      brilliant Heart Crystal and the friends she made: the rabbit, the deer, the birds all
      gathered to watch her go. She waves with one hand, the golden thread bracelet glowing
      on her wrist. Her expression mixes happiness with a touch of wistfulness. The portal
      pulses gently, calling her home. Sunset paints the sky in warm colors.

      Mona walked toward the glowing doorway that would take her home. She turned back to
      wave at all the creatures watching. The threads danced in the air, brighter than ever.
      Part of her wanted to stay and play here forever. But home had toys and her family and
      her own bed. The thread on her wrist pulsed warmly. She could come back. Maybe trying new things meant going home was just another adventure.
