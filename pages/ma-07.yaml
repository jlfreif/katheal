      Maya dances freely in a small performance space, her movements bold and
      uniquely hers—mixing styles, adding playful spins, letting her pink-streaked

      own authentic styles. A lantern burns steady on a post. Her expression
      shows joyful focus. This is working.

      freezing again, their authenticity dimming under the pressure of
      judgment. Her confident expression cracks to uncertainty.

      Then shadow-audiences appeared in the seats, whispering. "Too wild."
      "Not proper technique." "She's showing off." Maya's movements faltered.
      Was being herself really enough? Maybe she should dance more... correctly?
      The lantern flickered. Behind her, the freed performers began freezing
      again, their authentic styles dimming. "Wait, no," Maya said, but her
      voice sounded small. "I thought..."
