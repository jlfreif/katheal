    visual: |
      Mona sits back on her play mat in the sunny New York City apartment, exactly where she
      started. Her blocks are still scattered around her. Everything looks the same, but
      something feels different. She looks at her regular toys with new interest, the golden
      thread bracelet glowing softly on her wrist. Sunlight streams through the window normally
      now, no magical portal visible. She picks up a block, examining it like it might hold
      secrets. Her expression shows quiet wonder, seeing familiar things in a new way.

      Mona was home. Her apartment looked exactly the same as when she left. Blocks on the
      floor. Toys waiting. But she felt different. The golden thread on her wrist caught the
      sunlight, reminding her that trying new things led to magic. She looked at her blocks
      and wondered what she could build today that she'd never tried before.

    visual: |
      Mona stands reaching toward the window where the portal appeared, but now she's building
      a new tower of blocks that reaches higher than ever before, wobbling but holding. The
      golden thread on her wrist glows in response to her fearless creating. Around the room,
      subtle hints of magic appear: dust motes catch light like tiny golden threads, shadows
      seem warmer, colors more vibrant. She grins with pure confidence and joy, already planning
      her next big try. The city beyond the window seems full of possibilities. She's the same
      little girl, but braver.

      Mona stacked her blocks higher than ever, not worried about them falling. If they fell,
      she'd just try again. That's what brave people did. The golden thread pulsed on her
      wrist, and for just a moment, she thought she saw regular dust motes glow like the
      threads in Kathaél. Magic wasn't just in magical places. It happened every time you
      were brave enough to try something new. Mona smiled. She had so many new things to try.
