      Mona's playroom, the same blocks and toys as the opening. Mona toddles in holding her bunny
      and the golden star from Kathaél. She looks at her regular blocks with new eyes—the same
      toys, but she sees them differently now. The golden star glows softly in her hand. Her
      expression shows peaceful confidence. The atmosphere is familiar but transformed by courage
      learned and claimed.

      Mona sat in her playroom with her blocks, same as before Kathaél. But she wasn't the same.
      The golden star glowed next to bunny, warm and real. She looked at her toys—familiar, safe,
      but now she noticed new things too. That puzzle she'd never tried because it looked hard.
      Those stairs she'd been scared to climb. New things waited everywhere, just needing someone
      brave enough to try them.

      Mona attempting something new and challenging—standing on a step stool to reach a high shelf
      where a new toy waits, one she'd been too scared to try before. Bunny is nearby for support.
      The golden star glows brilliantly on the floor beside her. Golden threads appear faintly
      in her ordinary room, Kathaél's magic living in every brave choice. She reaches for the new
      toy with determination and joy. Her expression shows brave excitement. Small sparkles drift
      through the playroom. The scene feels triumphant but grounded—toddler-level magic made real
      through courage.

      Mona climbed on her step stool, reaching for the toy she'd been too scared to try. Her tummy
      felt fluttery, but that was okay. Fluttery meant new. New meant exciting. The golden star
      blazed bright. Tiny golden threads appeared in the air—Kathaél's magic living in every brave
      try. She grabbed the new toy and smiled big. This was her courage: trying new things even
      when scary. Every try made the next try easier. She was little, but she was brave.
