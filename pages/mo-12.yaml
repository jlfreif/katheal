      Mona's playroom, the same blocks and toys as the opening. Mona toddles in holding her bunny and
      a small golden star (the gift from the Library). She looks at her toys with new eyes. She picks
      up a block. "Why square?" she asks, tilting her head. Then smiles and just stacks it without
      needing the full answer. She still asks questions—that's who she is—but now she also acts. The
      star glows softly beside bunny. Her expression shows peaceful balance. The atmosphere is familiar
      but transformed by integrated wisdom. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona was home! She picked up a block. "Why square?" Then she stacked it! She still loved asking why. But now she also loved trying! The gold star sat with bunny.

      Mona approaches her step stool and the high shelf (same as original ending). But this time she
      pauses, questions if it's safe, sees it's sturdy, then acts by climbing. She reaches for a new
      toy. Pauses again—questioning if she wants it. Her tummy says yes. She grabs it. The star blazes
      with golden light. Tiny golden threads appear, connecting her questions and actions in perfect
      balance. Constellations shimmer faintly in the air, echoes of her pedestal. She laughs, delighted.
      Questions AND doing. Both courage. Her expression shows joyful confidence. The scene celebrates
      the wisdom of knowing when to think and when to trust. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white
      space at bottom.

      Mona saw her step stool. She looked. Safe? Yes! She climbed. She reached up. Want the toy? Yes! She grabbed it! The star lit up! Gold strings appeared! Stars shimmered above! Mona laughed. Ask why. Then try. That was brave!
