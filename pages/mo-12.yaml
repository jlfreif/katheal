      Mona's playroom, the same blocks and toys as the opening. Mona toddles in holding her bunny
      and the golden star from Kathaél. She looks at her regular blocks with new eyes—the same
      toys, but she sees them differently now. The golden star glows softly in her hand. Her
      expression shows peaceful confidence. The atmosphere is familiar but transformed by courage
      learned and claimed.

      Mona sat with her blocks. The golden star glowed next to bunny. She looked at toys she'd been too scared to try. New things waited everywhere.

      Mona attempting something new and challenging—standing on a step stool to reach a high shelf
      where a new toy waits, one she'd been too scared to try before. Bunny is nearby for support.
      The golden star glows brilliantly on the floor beside her. Golden threads appear faintly
      in her ordinary room, Kathaél's magic living in every brave choice. She reaches for the new
      toy with determination and joy. Her expression shows brave excitement. Small sparkles drift
      through the playroom. The scene feels triumphant but grounded—toddler-level magic made real
      through courage.

      Mona climbed her step stool reaching for the scary toy. Tummy fluttery. But fluttery meant new. The star blazed. Tiny golden threads appeared. She smiled big. Little, but brave.
