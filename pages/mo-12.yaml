    visual: |
      Mona sits on the same colorful mat at Gymboree, same position as the
      opening. But now the star-toy from Kathaél sits among her regular blocks,
      glowing softly. Another toddler sits nearby, looking uncertain at a
      complicated toy. Mona's expression is peaceful and confident, no longer
      just playing alone. She's reaching out to the other child with a block,
      inviting them to play. The teachers smile in the background. The room
      feels brighter somehow.

      Mona's mat looked the same: bright colors, soft floor, blocks everywhere.
      But Mona felt different. A little boy sat near her, staring at a puzzle
      that looked too hard. Mona remembered feeling too small, too little to
      help. But that was before. She picked up a puzzle piece and held it out
      to him. "Try together?" The boy blinked, then smiled. "Okay!" Mona's
      star-toy pulsed warm in her pocket.

    visual: |
      Mona and the little boy build together, trying to fit blocks into a new
      shape neither of them has made before. Mona's face shows concentration
      but also joy—not frustration, just curiosity about what will happen.
      Her star-toy glows gently beside them, encouraging. Through the window,
      a golden thread shimmers briefly in the sunlight. The butterfly from
      Kathaél appears for just a moment, blue and bright, before flying away.

      They tried a new shape together—not a tower, something different. A
      bridge! When it wobbled, they didn't give up. They tried again. And again.
      When it finally stood, both children clapped and giggled. Mona looked at
      her glowing star, then out the window where a blue butterfly danced past.
      She'd been scared lots of times in Kathaél. Too small, too little, too
      much. But she tried anyway. And trying—especially together—was how all
      the best things happened. She couldn't wait to try something new tomorrow.
