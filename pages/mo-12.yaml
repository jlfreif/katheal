      Mona's playroom, the same blocks and toys as the opening. Mona toddles in holding her bunny
      and a small golden seed (the gift from Kathaél). She looks at her toys with new eyes. She
      picks up a block. "Why square?" she asks, tilting her head. Then smiles and just stacks it
      without needing the answer. She still asks questions—that's who she is—but now she also
      acts. The seed glows softly beside bunny. Her expression shows peaceful balance. The
      atmosphere is familiar but transformed by integrated wisdom.

      Mona sat with her blocks. "Why square?" she asked. Then stacked it anyway. She still loved questions. But now she knew: some questions need answers. Some just need doing. The golden seed glowed next to bunny.

      Mona approaches her step stool and the high shelf (same as original ending). But this time
      she pauses, questions if it's safe, sees it's sturdy, then acts by climbing. She reaches
      for a new toy. Pauses again—questioning if she wants it. Her tummy says yes. She grabs it.
      The seed blazes with golden light. Tiny golden threads appear, connecting her questions and
      actions in perfect balance. She laughs, delighted. Questions AND doing. Both courage. Her
      expression shows joyful confidence. The scene celebrates the wisdom of knowing when to
      think and when to trust.

      Mona climbed her step stool. Paused. Safe? Yes. Climbed. Reached for the toy. Paused. Want it? Tummy said yes. She grabbed it. The seed blazed. Golden threads connected her questions to her actions. Perfect balance. She giggled. "Question when it matters. Do when it's time." Both were being brave.
