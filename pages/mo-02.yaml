      Mona toddles into the magnificent Library of Kathaél. Ancient trees with glowing books on
      branches. Floating scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books flutter playfully past. In the center,
      five pedestals surround the massive Heart Crystal. The constellation patterns pedestal glows
      before her, covered in star maps that need to be connected and arranged. Glowing constellation
      pieces float around it—shapes, stars, connecting lines. The Library shimmers with possibility.
      A tired rabbit sits by the pedestal. "The constellations won't align," it says. "We need someone
      who can figure out how they work." This is a real puzzle to solve—it needs Mona's investigating
      mind AND her willingness to try. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona found a big library! Trees had books. Stars floated. A rabbit sat sad. "The stars won't work," said the rabbit. Mona looked. The stars needed help!

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Mona toddles to the pedestal, tilting her head at the floating constellation pieces. She picks
      one up—it's warm and hums in her hand. "Why warm?" she asks, examining it. The piece glows
      brighter when she asks questions! She asks "Why this shape?" and it pulses. She studies it, then
      presses it against the pedestal where it seems to fit. Click! A tiny connection forms between
      two stars. The rabbit gasps. Mona grins—her questions help her investigate, and then she acts
      on what she learns. She reaches for another constellation piece. The atmosphere shifts from
      stillness to excitement as the first piece of the puzzle slots into place. Text in Times New
      Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.
