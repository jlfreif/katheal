      Mona toddles through a shimmering doorway made of golden light, still
      clutching the glowing block. She emerges into a magical meadow where
      everything looks slightly faded—flowers that should be bright pink are
      pale, toys scattered on the grass have dull colors. She walks forward
      with her characteristic confident waddle, looking around with wide,
      curious eyes. The glowing block pulses brighter against the faded world.

      The block tugged at Mona's hand, pulling her forward. One wobbly step,
      then another, and whoosh! Everything changed. Mona stood in a big meadow
      full of flowers and toys, but something was wrong. The flowers looked
      tired. A doll's dress used to be red—Mona could tell—but now it was
      almost gray. She frowned. That wasn't right. Things should be bright
      and happy!

    focus: Decision to act

    visual: |
      Mona crouches down to eye level with a beautiful butterfly whose wings
      are fading from vibrant blue to pale gray. The butterfly sits on a wilted
      flower, wings drooping. Mona's hand reaches out gently, her expression
      serious and empathetic despite her young age. Her glowing block sits beside
      her on the grass, pulsing softly. In the background, more faded toys and
      flowers stretch into the distance toward a dimly glowing crystal structure.

      A butterfly landed on Mona's knee. Its wings were see-through and sad,
      like they forgot how to be blue. "Can't fly," it whispered in a voice
      like wind chimes. "Too scared. Forgot how." Mona's little face got very
      serious. She knew that feeling—when something new seemed too big and
      scary. But Mona also knew a secret: trying was how you learned! She
      picked up her glowing block and held it out to the butterfly. "Try with
      me?" The butterfly's wings flickered, just a little bit brighter.
