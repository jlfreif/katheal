    visual: |
      Mona stands in a luminous forest clearing in Kathaél, surrounded by ancient trees with
      glowing moss at their bases. Golden threads fill the air around her, but many are knotted
      and tangled together, their light flickering weakly. Some threads droop toward the ground,
      lifeless. Mona's expression shifts from wonder to concern as she notices a particularly
      sad-looking cluster of threads hanging limp near her face. She reaches up to touch one
      gently. The clearing has a twilight quality, beautiful but troubled.

      Mona gasped. She stood in a forest that glowed. Golden threads floated everywhere, but
      something was wrong. Many were twisted into knots, their light going dim. A thread
      drifted past her cheek, barely glowing at all. It looked sad. Mona's brow furrowed.
      Why were the pretty threads hurting?

    focus: Decision to act

    visual: |
      Mona crouches down, both hands reaching toward a tangle of threads resting on the mossy
      ground. Her face shows pure determination despite her young age, tilted head focused on
      the problem. A small luminous rabbit sits nearby, watching her with interest. The threads
      near Mona begin to glow slightly brighter, responding to her fearless presence. Her curly
      hair catches the golden light. Behind her, paths branch out in multiple directions through
      the forest, all lined with more threads waiting to be helped.

      Mona didn't know words like "magic" or "problem" yet. But she knew when something
      needed help. At home, when her blocks fell down, she built them back up. When her
      stuffed bunny looked lonely, she gave it hugs. These threads needed help too. She
      reached for the nearest tangle. "I fix!"
