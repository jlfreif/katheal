      A magical garden in Kathaél where a fountain is frozen mid-splash, flowers frozen mid-bloom,
      butterflies suspended mid-flight. Everything stuck between question and answer. Mona toddles
      in, eyes wide. A sign reads in glowing letters: "Why should it splash? Why should it bloom?
      Why should they fly?" All questions, no actions. Other toddlers stand frozen too, asking
      "why why why" but never moving forward. Golden threads hang limp and dim. The atmosphere
      feels stuck, paralyzed by endless questioning without doing.

      Mona found a garden where nothing moved. A fountain frozen mid-splash. Flowers frozen mid-bloom. Butterflies stuck in air. A sign glowed: "Why should it splash? Why bloom? Why fly?" Too many questions. No one just doing.

    visual: |
      A small rabbit hops to Mona, looking very tired. "We've been asking 'why' forever," it says.
      "But no one will just try." Mona tilts her head, processing. She looks at the frozen fountain.
      At the stuck butterflies. She could ask more questions. Or she could just... do something.
      She walks to the fountain and touches the water. It doesn't move. Mona frowns. "Why frozen?"
      she starts to ask, then stops herself. She scoops water with her hands. It trickles. The
      fountain shimmers. Her expression shows a dawning understanding. The atmosphere begins to
      shift from paralysis toward possibility.

      A rabbit hopped close. "We've been asking why forever. But no one tries." Mona looked at the frozen fountain. She could ask more questions. Or... She touched the water. Stuck. "Why fro—" No. She scooped water anyway. It trickled. The fountain shimmered gold.
