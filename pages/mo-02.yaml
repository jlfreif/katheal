      Mona toddles into the magnificent Library of Kathaél. Ancient trees with glowing books on
      branches. Floating scrolls chime like wind chimes. Books flutter playfully past. In the center,
      five pedestals surround the massive Heart Crystal. Her pedestal glows before her, empty and
      waiting. Magical blocks float around the room—colorful, glowing, different shapes and sizes.
      Some are stone, some are clouds, some shimmer like light. A tired rabbit sits by the empty
      pedestal. "The towers fell down," it says sadly. "We need someone who can stack them tall!"
      This needs Mona's investigating mind AND her willingness to try. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

    focus: Decision to act
    visual: |
      Mona toddles to the pedestal, tilting her head at the floating blocks. She picks one up—it's
      warm and hums in her hand. "Why warm?" she asks, examining it. The block glows brighter when
      she asks questions! She asks "Why round?" and it pulses. She studies it, then gently places it
      on the pedestal. It stays! A tiny glow appears. The rabbit gasps. Mona grins—her questions
      help her investigate, and then she acts on what she learns. She reaches for another block.
      The atmosphere shifts from stillness to excitement as the first block of the tower sits steady.
