      A magical playground in Kathaél with swings that don't swing, a slide with no one sliding,
      a sandbox with toys frozen mid-scoop. Everything is still and waiting. Mona toddles into
      the playground, holding her stuffed bunny, looking around with wide eyes. The equipment is
      beautiful—colorful and inviting—but completely motionless. Golden threads connect the toys
      but they're dim and lifeless. A few other children stand at the edges, too afraid to try
      anything. Mona tilts her head, confused. Playgrounds are for playing. Why is everyone just
      standing? The atmosphere feels suspended, waiting for someone to be brave enough to start.

      Mona found a playground where nothing moved. Swings hung still. Slides sat empty. Children stood at the edges, too afraid to play.

    visual: |
      Mona walks determinedly toward the swings despite the other children's warnings, her little
      legs moving with toddler purpose. She still clutches her bunny but reaches for a swing
      with her other hand. Her expression shows a mix of uncertainty and brave determination—
      that toddler courage that hasn't learned to overthink. The swing begins to glow faintly
      as she approaches. Other children lean forward, watching. A golden thread brightens. The
      atmosphere shifts from frozen waiting to anticipatory hope. This tiny girl might be small,
      but she's willing to try.

      Mona walked to the swings, bunny tucked under one arm. Her tummy felt fluttery. But new things could be fun. "I try," she said. The swing glowed and came alive.
