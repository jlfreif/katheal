      A magical garden in Kathaél where a fountain is frozen mid-splash, flowers frozen mid-bloom,
      butterflies suspended mid-flight. Everything locked in crystal ice. Mona toddles in, eyes
      wide with curiosity. A tired rabbit sits by the fountain. "The spell won't break," it says.
      "We need someone who can figure out how it works." Glowing puzzle pieces float around the
      frozen fountain—shapes, symbols, colors. The garden shimmers cold and still. Golden threads
      hang dim and waiting. This is a real puzzle to solve, not just overthinking—it needs Mona's
      investigating mind.

      Mona found a garden frozen in crystal ice. Fountain mid-splash. Flowers mid-bloom. Butterflies stuck in air. A rabbit sat by the fountain. "The spell won't break. We need someone who can figure it out." Glowing puzzle pieces floated everywhere. This needed investigating.

    visual: |
      Mona toddles to the fountain, tilting her head at the floating puzzle pieces. She picks one
      up—it's warm and hums in her hand. "Why warm?" she asks, examining it. The piece glows
      brighter when she asks questions! She asks "Why this shape?" and it pulses. She presses it
      against the frozen fountain. Click! A tiny crack appears in the ice. The rabbit gasps. Mona
      grins—her questions help her investigate, and then she acts on what she learns. She reaches
      for another puzzle piece. The atmosphere shifts from stillness to excitement as the first
      piece of the puzzle slots into place.
