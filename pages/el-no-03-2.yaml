      Ellie takes Noah's hand and together they walk a few steps down the middle path toward
      the glowing hollow. The paperbird flies ahead, wings now shifting to warm gold. Ellie
      points at mushrooms growing in impossible spirals, at a tree whose bark shows constellation
      patterns. Noah still looks uncertain, but he's walking. His compass has stopped spinning—
      the needle now points steadily down this path. Ellie notices and grins.

      "See? You picked one!" Ellie squeezed his hand as they walked. Noah glanced at his compass—
      it had settled, pointing forward. Maybe choosing itself was the magic.

      The paperbird suddenly darts off the main path, diving into a thicket of flowering vines.
      Ellie laughs and waves to Noah, already turning to chase it. "That way for me!" she calls
      over her shoulder. Noah stands alone now at a smaller fork, holding his compass. But
      something has shifted—his posture is straighter, his expression more determined than
      anxious. Ellie's warmth lingers like sunlight. The paperbird flashes once between the trees,
      and she's gone.

      "Pick the one that scares you most—that's usually the interesting one!" Ellie called as she
      darted after her paperbird. Noah stood alone again, but this time he wasn't frozen. He chose
      the path his compass showed, and started walking.
