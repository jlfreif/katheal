      Max works through a challenge course, his form less perfect but his
      movement continuous. When he stumbles, he corrects and keeps going.
      Behind him, restored obstacles glow with golden light. A lantern burns
      steady on a post nearby. His expression shows focused determination.
      This is working.

      Max ran the course again, but differently this time. When he stumbled
      on a balance beam, he didn't restart. He caught himself, adjusted,
      kept moving. The beam began to glow. He missed a handhold on the wall,
      grabbed another, pulled himself up. The wall shimmered to life. The
      lantern beside him burned steady. "Yes! It's working!"

    visual: |
      Max stands frozen before a collapsed challenge—ropes tangled, structures
      broken—a mistake so big it looks unfixable. His hands clench in
      frustration. The lantern's flame sputters and dims. Behind him, his
      restored challenges begin to grey again. His expression shows the old
      habit of wanting to quit returning.

      Then Max reached a challenge he'd completely destroyed earlier. Ropes
      tangled, structure collapsed, broken beyond recognition. His hands
      clenched. This wasn't a small mistake. This was massive failure. The
      lantern beside him flickered and dimmed. His restored challenges behind
      him began to grey. "I can't fix this," Max muttered, already stepping
      back. "This is too broken."
