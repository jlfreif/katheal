      Maya finds herself back at the word riddles pedestal in the Library's central chamber. The
      massive riddle glowing above it is the same one from the beginning, but now she approaches it
      differently. She kneels before it, taking time to really read, not rushing to judgment, not
      trying to understand everything, just being present with the words. Her expression shows patient
      attention and growing wisdom. The atmosphere is quiet and sacred. Books hover nearby, watching.

      Maya found herself back at the word riddles pedestal. The central riddle glowed above it, same as the beginning. This time she didn't rush. Didn't judge. She knelt before it, patient. One layer at a time. Willing to see.

      As Maya truly reads the riddle—not rushing, not overwhelmed, just present—the words bloom into
      brilliant light. The riddle reads: "What holds everything yet weighs nothing? What breaks when
      spoken yet is made of words?" The answer is both surface and depth: Promise (surface) and Truth
      (deeper). She understands now that meanings work together, not against each other. The pedestal
      erupts in golden light. Golden threads blaze from it, connecting to the other four pedestals
      around the Heart Crystal, showing how all the patterns link together. Maya's expression shows
      deep understanding. The path forward is clear. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at

      The riddle blazed as Maya truly read it. "What holds everything yet weighs nothing? What breaks when spoken yet is made of words?" Promise. Truth. Both answers true. Surface and depth working together, not fighting. The pedestal erupted in golden light. Golden threads connected to the other pedestals across the Library. Others were solving their challenges at the exact same moment. She could feel them. "Together," she breathed. The Heart Crystal pulsed brighter.
