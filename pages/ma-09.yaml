      Maya stands up, paintbrush gripped tight, facing the faded garden with renewed determination.
      She opens her paint set and goes straight for the most shocking, brightest colors—the ones
      she'd been afraid were too much. Electric pink, neon orange, vibrant purple. Her posture
      is bold and decisive. The tiny stubborn flower watches. Her expression shows fierce courage
      and commitment. The atmosphere shifts from defeated to defiant, from holding back to going
      all in.

      Maya grabbed her paintbrush and went for the colors she'd been afraid were too much. The
      brightest pink, the wildest orange, the boldest purple she could mix. She'd been holding
      back, trying to be bold enough but not too bold. But that tiny flower showed her the truth:
      half-authentic didn't work. Kathaél didn't need careful boldness. It needed complete, fearless,
      all-in authenticity. No more holding back.

    visual: |
      Maya paints with complete abandon, wild strokes of shocking color across flowers, trees,
      sky—not careful or controlled but utterly authentic. Where she paints with full commitment,
      the colors not only stick but spread, bleeding outward from her brush strokes, transforming
      everything around them. Golden threads blaze to life, weaving through her artwork. The
      garden explodes into vibrant life—not just where she painted but everywhere, as if her full
      authenticity gave permission for everything else to be fully itself too. Her expression
      shows amazed joy. The atmosphere blazes with colorful triumph and revelation.

      Maya painted like she'd never been afraid, slashing color everywhere with wild, joyful
      abandon. And this time it stuck. It spread. It transformed. Where she painted with her whole
      authentic self, the colors exploded outward, waking everything up. The garden blazed vibrant—
      not just her colors but its own colors, fully themselves. Golden threads wove through every
      bloom. That was the secret. When you're completely yourself, you give everything else
      permission to be itself too.
