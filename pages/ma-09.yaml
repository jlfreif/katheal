      Maya finds herself back at the clearing from the beginning—the place where she almost
      walked off the cliff by trusting surface appearances. The grey rock from her painting sits
      there, still cracked open but now she approaches it differently. She kneels before it,
      taking time to really observe, not rushing to judgment, not trying to understand everything,
      just being present with what's there. Her expression shows patient attention and growing
      wisdom. The atmosphere is quiet and sacred.

      Maya found herself back at the beginning, where she'd almost fallen. The grey rock sat there, cracked open. This time she didn't rush. Didn't judge. She knelt before it, patient. One thing at a time. Willing to see.

      As Maya truly sees the rock—not rushing, not overwhelmed, just present—the crystals inside
      bloom into brilliant light. But more importantly, she sees the whole pattern now: the rock
      protected the crystals, the grey surface wasn't boring but necessary, the crack revealed
      truth at the right moment. She understands that surfaces and depths both matter. Golden
      threads blaze from the rock, connecting to everything in the forest, showing how all things
      have hidden depths waiting to be truly seen. The path to the Heart Crystal appears clearly.
      Her expression shows deep understanding.

      The rock's crystals blazed as Maya truly saw them. Not just the hidden beauty, but why it was hidden. The grey protected the crystals. The surface mattered. The depths mattered. Both. Together. Golden threads connected everything, each thing holding its own secret depths. She could see now. Really see. The path to the Heart Crystal opened clear.
