    visual: |
      Maya stands, pushing her pink-streaked hair back determinedly. The
      shadow-audiences still loom, but she's not looking at them anymore.
      She's looking at the grey butterfly, at the weak thread, at the empty
      stage that's waiting. Her posture shifts to bold and ready. Paint-stained
      hands open at her sides.

      Maya stood. The shadow-audiences were still there, still judging. But
      she remembered her bedroom, painting dancers because she loved how they
      moved. Not for teachers. Not for perfect technique. For the joy of it.
      "I didn't come here to perform for you," Maya said to the shadows. Her
      voice grew stronger. "I came here to be myself."

    focus: Discovering the missed clue

    visual: |
      Maya dances boldly, authentically, mixing every style she loves. The
      shadow-audiences dissolve like smoke. Golden threads shimmer into
      visibility, connecting her to warmth beyond the stage—someone else
      choosing courage at the same moment. The butterfly's wings bloom with
      color. Flowers grow where she dances. The stage transforms.

    text: |
      Maya danced—big bold leaps, silly spins, mixing ballet with hip-hop
      with moves she just invented. The shadow-audiences dissolved. Golden
      light rippled through the air, warm as a hug from someone far away being
      brave at exactly the same moment. The butterfly's wings burst into color.
      Flowers bloomed where her feet touched the stage. "Being myself," Maya
      laughed, "is exactly enough."
