      Maya finds herself back at the Living Canvas pedestal in the Library's central chamber. The
      central blank canvas glows above it, the same one from the beginning, but now she approaches it
      differently. She kneels before it, brush in hand, taking time to be present, not rushing, not
      forcing, just ready to paint with honesty. Her expression shows patient attention and growing
      wisdom. The atmosphere is quiet and sacred. Books hover nearby, watching. Brushes and paints
      wait patiently.

      Having overcome the intense challenge, Maya returned to the Living Canvas pedestal. The central blank canvas glowed above it, same as the beginning. This time she didn't rush. Didn't force it. She knelt before it, patient. One brushstroke at a time. Willing to paint truly.

      As Maya paints—not rushing, not overwhelmed, just present and honest—the painting blooms into
      brilliant life. She paints a tree that grows and shifts through seasons: spring blossoms, summer
      leaves, autumn colors, winter branches, then spring again in an endless living cycle. The tree
      sways in wind that isn't there. Birds land in its branches and sing. It's FULLY ALIVE, truly
      real, stable and lasting. She gave it time, presence, and emotional truth. The pedestal erupts
      in golden light. Golden threads blaze from it, connecting to the other four pedestals around the
      Heart Crystal, showing how all the patterns link together. Maya's expression shows deep understanding.
      The path forward is clear.

      The painting blazed as Maya truly created it. A tree cycling through seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter, spring again. She'd given it time, presence, honest emotion. The pedestal erupted in golden light. Golden threads connected to the other pedestals across the Library. Others were solving their challenges at the exact same moment. She could feel them. "Together," she breathed. It was time to find her friends.
