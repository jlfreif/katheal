      Elise walks carefully through the Whispering Woods, eyes wide as she observes everything.
      Unlike someone rushing through, she notices each wonder: mushrooms that glow softly,
      moss patterns that look like tiny cities, flowers that chime when touched. The paperbird
      leads her forward, pausing occasionally to make sure she's following. Elise's sketchbook
      is open in her hands—she can't help but quickly sketch the bioluminescent mushrooms. Her
      expression shows wonder mixed with concern for the fading paperbird.

      The woods were full of wonders Elise ached to draw—glowing mushrooms, singing flowers,
      trees that whispered. But the paperbird kept fading, colors growing dimmer. She had to keep going.

      The paperbird flies to a small grove where other paperbirds gather—but these are vibrant,
      healthy, their wings flashing brilliant colors (emerald, sapphire, ruby, gold). Elise's
      paperbird looks so faded next to them, its colors barely visible. The other paperbirds
      seem to sing in concern, circling the fading one. Elise kneels, watching, trying to
      understand. Her gentle, observant nature helps her see: something is missing from her
      paperbird. But what?

      Other paperbirds gathered, singing in crystalline voices. Next to them, Elise's paperbird
      looked almost transparent. They were trying to help, but something was still wrong. Elise
      watched carefully, noticing everything.
