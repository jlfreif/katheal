    As Noah sits at his lowest, questioning everything, Ellie—miles away in the woods—
    feels a sudden tug at her heart. Not words, but knowing: Noah needs her. She follows
    the feeling without question, arriving exactly when he needs grounding most. The feather
    charm becomes Noah's anchor—physical proof that courage can be carried and shared. Ellie
    learns that her gift isn't just enthusiasm but also the ability to calm storms in others'
    hearts.

  Noah and Ellie sit together as gentle wind sweeps across the cliff—steady, warm, like an
  embrace. Noah holds the feather charm close to his heart. His posture has changed—shoulders
  a little straighter, breathing easier. Beside him, his compass begins to glow brighter again,
  as if responding to his renewed calm. Ellie leans her head on his shoulder. The sky stretches
  before them—vast but no longer overwhelming. The wind carries possibility.

  Noah sat at the edge of the Cliff of Gentle Winds, head in hands, compass lying beside him.
  "I can't do it, Ellie," he said quietly as footsteps approached. "The compass keeps pointing
  forward, but I don't know if I'm strong enough to keep following." Ellie plops down beside him
  without a word, just being there. The wind was soft and warm—the kind that makes you feel less
  alone. After a moment, she held out her hand. "I made you something." The feather charm glowed
  faintly in Noah's palm—sky-moth wings catching the last light. "You don't have to know the whole
  path," Ellie whispered. "Just the next step. This helps me feel brave. Maybe it can help you too."
  "Thank you," Noah's eyes welled slightly. They sat as gentle winds embraced them both. Noah
  tucked the charm into his pocket, feeling its warmth. His compass pulsed—not commanding, but
  encouraging. "I can try again," Noah said quietly. Ellie smiled. "That's all you ever have to do."
