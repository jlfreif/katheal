      Max walks back through Kathaél toward home. The wristband glows warmly on his wrist. Around
      him, the challenge courses move in perfect rhythm, restored and stronger. The fox sits on a
      branch, watching him go with approval. Max calls out "Thanks for the workout!" The fox's
      tail swishes. Ahead, Max's basketball hoop gleams, exactly where he left it. The atmosphere
      is one of accomplishment. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max stands in his driveway, basketball in hand, the wristband glowing softly. He takes a
      shot - swish! He grins with satisfaction. Not because he learned to accept failure, but
      because he proved he can adapt to anything. He shoots again, adjusting mid-release when the
      wind picks up. Another swish. At the tree line, a golden thread catches the light. The fox
      from Kathaél tilts its head. Max waves, ready for whatever comes next. Text in Times New

      Max picked up his basketball, the wristband humming softly. He took a shot. Swish. He grinned. Not because he'd learned to accept failure. Because he'd proven that genuinely hard challenges just need persistence and creativity. He could adapt to anything. He shot again, adjusting his angle mid-release when the wind picked up. Swish. At the tree line, a golden thread caught the light. The fox tilted its head. Max waved. "Ready when you are."
