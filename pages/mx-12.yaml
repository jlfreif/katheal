      Max's workshop room, the same setup as the opening. The failed automatic sorter still sits
      on the desk. Max enters his room and looks at it with completely different eyes. The crystal
      gear from Kathaél rests on his desk beside the broken invention, glowing faintly. His
      trombone case, basketball, and blueprints all the same, but he sees them differently now.
      His expression shows peaceful confidence. The atmosphere is familiar but transformed by
      new understanding.

      Max sat at his desk, looking at the automatic sorter that had failed before Kathaél. The
      broken device sat exactly as he'd left it, proof of imperfect attempts. But now it looked
      different. Not like failure. Like version one. The crystal gear glowed beside it, reminding
      him that trying mattered more than immediate success. He picked up his tools, ready to
      experiment. Not to get it perfect. To see what would happen.

      Max works on a new experiment, laughing as he tries something ridiculous just to see what
      happens. Gears and springs scattered playfully across his desk. The crystal gear glows
      bright, and on his workbench, golden threads appear faintly, responding to his joyful
      curiosity. He's built three versions already (visible in various states of assembly), each
      one teaching him something new. His basketball bounces in the corner, having been incorporated
      into an experiment. Small sparkles drift through his ordinary room. His whole being radiates
      curious courage. The scene feels triumphant but grounded—magic made practical through
      playful persistence.

      Max tried version seven (versions one through six sat nearby, honored as teachers). This
      one had a ridiculous addition—a spring that probably served no purpose. He laughed, curious
      what would happen. The crystal gear blazed. Golden threads wove through his work. Kathaél's
      magic lived in every brave experiment, every playful try. He'd learned his courage: not
      being right the first time, but having the guts to keep experimenting. Failure wasn't the
      opposite of success. It was part of the process.
