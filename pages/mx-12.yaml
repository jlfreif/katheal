    focus: Returning to ordinary world
    visual: |
      Max walks back through the Library of Kathaél toward home. The wristband glows warmly on his wrist.
      Around him, obstacle courses connected to the pedestal move in perfect rhythm, restored and stronger.
      Rope swings arc through the Library air. Balance beams shift smoothly. Handholds rotate in beautiful
      patterns. Challenges alive and flowing. Books flutter peacefully. The fox sits on a branch, watching
      him go with approval. Max calls out "Thanks for the workout!" The fox's tail swishes. Ahead through
      golden threads, Max's basketball hoop gleams beyond the Library, exactly where he left it. The
      atmosphere is one of accomplishment. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max stands in his driveway, basketball in hand, the wristband glowing softly. He takes a shot—
      swish! He grins with satisfaction. Not because he learned to accept failure, but because he proved
      he can adapt to anything. He shoots again, adjusting mid-release when the wind picks up—reading
      the change and flowing with it. Another swish. Faint golden threads shimmer in the air, echoes of
      the Library's obstacle courses and pedestal. At the tree line, a golden thread catches the light.
      The fox tilts its head. Max waves, ready for whatever comes next. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in

      Max picked up his basketball, the wristband humming softly. He took a shot. Swish. He grinned. Not because he'd learned to accept failure. Because he'd proven that genuinely hard challenges just need persistence and creativity. He could adapt to anything. He shot again, adjusting his angle mid-release when the wind picked up. Swish. At the tree line, a golden thread caught the light. The fox tilted its head. Max waved. "Ready when you are."
