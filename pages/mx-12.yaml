    visual: |
      Max stands in his driveway in the same position as the opening, basketball
      in hand, same hoop above the garage. But the chalk marks on the pavement
      now show a trail of adjustments leading to improvement, not just failures.
      The wristband glows softly on his wrist. His trombone case still leans
      against the garage. His expression is calm, curious.

      Max's driveway looked the same: afternoon light, basketball hoop, chalk
      marks on the pavement. But he didn't feel the same. He picked up the
      basketball, set his position. The wristband hummed on his wrist. "Okay,"
      he said to the hoop. "Let's see what this attempt shows me."

      Max shoots. The ball clangs off the rim—but he grins instead of getting
      frustrated. He adjusts his stance based on the miss and shoots again.
      This shot swishes through. The wristband glows brighter. A golden thread
      shimmers at the edge of his vision, unfinished and inviting. The bird
      from Kathaél watches from a tree branch.

      Clang. The ball bounced off the rim. Max grinned. "Too much force," he
      muttered, adjusting. He shot again. Swish. The wristband glowed warm
      against his skin. "Not about being perfect," he said, retrieving the
      ball. "It's about figuring it out as you go." At the tree's edge, a
      golden thread caught the light. The bird from Kathaél tilted its head.
      Max waved. More adventures were definitely coming.
