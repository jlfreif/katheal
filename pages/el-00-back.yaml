      Back cover design with soft watercolor background in gentle pinks, warm creams, and
      mist blues. Golden threads create a flowing, dance-like border around the edges,
      moving like ribbons in graceful curves. Musical notes made of golden light are
      scattered throughout. A small facet of the Heart Crystal glows softly in the upper
      corner, refracting soft colors. The golden threads form decorative frames for the
      text areas. At the bottom, tiny silhouettes of six children (representing all the
      characters) stand together, connected by shimmering golden threads. The overall
      atmosphere is warm, expressive, and inviting, with delicate ink linework adding
      detail to the flowing elements. Space in the center is left clear for text placement.

      When Elise discovers the Library of Kathaél, she finds a world where creativity has
      faded and performances have frozen mid-motion. The Heart Crystal is cracking, and
      stories need someone who can dance them back to life. To help, Elise must find the
      courage to express herself fully—not to be perfect, but to be truly present.
