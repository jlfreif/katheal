      Deep in the woods, Noah emerges into a grove where massive trees grow in a perfect circle.
      In the center stands Bramblebeard—a giant creature made of twisted vines, moss, and ancient
      bark, easily twelve feet tall. His beard is literally made of brambles with tiny flowers
      growing in it. His eyes glow amber. He's blocking the path forward, arms crossed, expression
      stern. Noah looks tiny by comparison, clutching his compass nervously.

      "Halt!" thundered a voice like rocks grinding. Bramblebeard the moss giant loomed before Noah,
      blocking the path. "Many come seeking. Few understand what they find."

      Bramblebeard leans down, examining Noah with one massive eye. Noah holds up the Cartographer's
      Compass bravely, though his hand trembles slightly. The giant's expression softens a fraction—
      recognition flickers across his craggy features. He points with a mossy finger toward the far
      side of the grove, where strange stone pillars stand in a circle. The compass in Noah's hand
      pulses in response.

      The giant studied Noah's compass, then grunted. "You carry the Seeker's tool. But beware—
      the Singing Stones ahead test more than navigation. They test whether you can hear truth
      beneath the noise."
