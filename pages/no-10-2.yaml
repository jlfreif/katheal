      Noah places both the Cartographer's Compass and the feather charm on the pillar of light.
      The pillar accepts them, and brilliant golden light explodes outward—not destructive but
      illuminating. The light flows through Noah, warm and transforming. He sees every path he
      walked superimposed—the cave, the stones, the cliff, the pool—each one a necessary step.
      He sees Ellie at the fork, Bramblebeard's warning, the Fox's riddles. Everything connects.
      His eyes are closed but he's never seen more clearly.

      Light poured through Noah—every choice, every doubt, every brave step forming a map inside
      his heart. The compass wasn't an object. It was a gift of knowing: trust yourself.

      The light fades, leaving Noah transformed—not visibly different, but radiating quiet confidence.
      The physical compass and feather charm have merged into a single glowing symbol that now rests
      as a gentle warmth in his chest—part of him forever. The silver trees bow slightly in honor.
      Paperbirds sing their crystalline song. Noah opens his eyes, smiling. The Whispering Woods
      acknowledge their new Pathfinder. He turns to walk home, finally understanding: he is his own
      compass now.

      Noah stood in the fading light, forever changed. The compass lived inside him now—not as
      certainty, but as courage to choose anyway. He smiled and turned toward home, knowing exactly
      which way to go.
