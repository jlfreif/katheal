      Elise steps out of the Whispering Woods into the golden meadow where both siblings' journeys
      began. Noah waits there, and his face lights up when he sees her. They run to embrace in the
      middle of the meadow. The restored paperbird circles around both of them joyfully, its colors
      painting the air with light. Noah holds up Bramblebeard's glowing acorn; Elise holds up her
      vibrant paperbird. They've both found what they needed. The afternoon sun makes everything
      feel magical and complete.

      "You saved it!" Noah called, amazed at the brilliantly colored paperbird. Elise smiled—shy
      but proud. "I found my voice," she said simply. Noah squeezed her hand. "It was always there.
      I'm glad you can hear it now too."

      The siblings sit together in the meadow grass, Noah showing Elise his acorn, Elise showing
      Noah her starlight journal. The paperbird perches on Elise's shoulder, preening its vibrant
      wings contentedly. "Want to plant the acorn together?" Noah asks. Elise nods, pulling out
      her sketchbook. "And I'll draw everything," she says—speaking up easily now, knowing her
      observations matter. Behind them, the Whispering Woods rustle with approval. New adventures
      await, but for now, they're home.

      They sat together sharing their treasures—acorn and paperbird, compass-wisdom and voice-courage.
      "Together," they both said. The woods whispered yes, and the paperbird sang in agreement. Home,
      but transformed. Changed, but still themselves.
