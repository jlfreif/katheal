      The new path leads Noah through a tunnel of flowering trees, their blossoms glowing faintly
      with bioluminescence as night falls. The path spirals gently downward, deeper into the woods'
      heart. Noah walks with the compass in one hand, feather charm in the other, both glowing in
      response to this sacred place. Paperbirds fly beside him like escorts. The air hums with
      ancient magic. Ahead, a grove of silver trees marks the destination.

      The path descended into the Heart of the Whispering Woods—a place few found because it could
      only be reached by trusting your own direction. Noah walked steadily, ready for whatever came next.

      Noah emerges into a grove of silver trees surrounding a central pillar of pure light—not
      made of stone but of crystallized time and truth itself. The Cartographer's Compass pulls
      strongly toward it, glowing so brightly Noah has to squint. This is the moment—the threshold.
      Noah stands before the pillar, one hand extended. His expression shows determination but also
      peace. This is what he came for. This is his choice to make.

      The pillar of truth stood before him, humming with ancient power. "Show me," Noah said to
      the compass, to himself, to the journey. "Show me what I was always meant to find." The
      light grew blinding.
