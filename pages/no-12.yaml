  Noah sits cross-legged on his bedroom floor in the exact same position as the
  opening, surrounded by notebooks and papers. But everything is subtly transformed.
  He's writing in his notebook with focused intent, the golden quill of light from
  Kathaél visible as a faint shimmer in his ordinary pen. His expression is engaged
  and content—not wistful or restless like before, but present and purposeful. The
  page visible in his notebook shows writing that flows naturally, with no crossed-out
  lines. The afternoon light streaming through the window is the same, but now there's
  a barely perceptible golden thread visible at the window's edge, a reminder that
  Kathaél is still connected to his world. His ukulele leans against the wall in the
  same spot, but now there's a golden thread wound around one of its strings, so
  subtle that only someone who knew to look for it would notice. The room is identical
  in its arrangement—same blue quilt, same desk, same books—but the quality of the
  scene has shifted from longing to connection. On the open page of his notebook, the
  first sentence is visible: "This is a story about learning that truth matters more
  than perfection." Outside the window, the ordinary suburban trees are just trees,
  but one small bird sits on a branch, and its eyes catch the light in a way that
  suggests it might be more than it seems.

  Noah opened his notebook and began to write—not the perfect story, but a true one. He knew now that somewhere in Kathaél, his words would matter.
