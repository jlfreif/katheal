      Golden threads gently deposit Noah back in his bedroom. He lands in his desk chair, slightly dizzy.
      Everything looks the same. Books on shelves. Climbing gear. Basketball trophies. His laptop still open
      to the video chat (his friend looking confused). The Rubik's cube on his desk. But Noah grins, eyes
      bright with adventure. He closes the chat with a quick "Gotta go!" His notebook lies open to his board
      game design. He looks at it with fresh eyes. The atmosphere is ordinary world seen anew. Text in Times

      Golden threads set Noah down in his chair. His room. His desk. His friend stared from the laptop. "Dude, you okay? You zoned out." Noah laughed. "Yeah. Just had an idea." He closed the chat. Looked at his board game design. The puzzle he'd been stuck on for weeks.

      Noah writes excitedly in his notebook, redesigning his board game. Instead of a solo puzzle, he's making
      it a team challenge where players must coordinate and communicate. Five different roles. Interconnected
      patterns. Requires multiple attempts and learning together. His voluminous hair bounces as he works
      enthusiastically. Through his window, a single golden thread glimmers briefly before fading. He catches
      it out of the corner of his eye and grins. His ukulele leans nearby. The atmosphere celebrates growth
      through adventure. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah grabbed his pen. Not a solo puzzle. A team challenge! Five roles. Interconnected patterns. Players would need to coordinate. Communicate. Try different approaches. Learn together. He sketched furiously, grinning. This was so much better. A golden thread glimmered outside his window, then faded. Noah saw it and smiled. Some adventures you face alone. But the best ones? You solve them together.
