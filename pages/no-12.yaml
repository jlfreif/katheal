      Noah's desk. The same setup as the opening. Outlines and character charts still there. But
      different now. Noah sits down and looks at them. Picks up his detailed plot diagram. Smiles
      gently. The golden quill from Kathaél rests beside his keyboard, glowing softly. He takes
      his color-coded plan and sets it aside—not throwing it away, but not letting it control him
      either. His room the same. But his relationship to control has transformed. His expression
      is peaceful, open. The atmosphere is letting go.

      Noah sat at his desk. The outlines still there. The character charts. The detailed plans. He looked at them with new eyes. Plans were fine. Guidance was okay. But control? Control killed stories. He set the outline aside. Opened a blank page. The golden quill hummed.

      Noah types, and this time when words appear on their own, he lets them. His characters make
      choices he didn't plan. The plot goes somewhere unexpected. He feels the urge to control,
      redirect, fix—but he breathes and lets it unfold. The quill glows brighter. Golden threads
      shimmer on screen. His story is alive, wild, finding its own truth. He laughs with joy and
      terror. Still uncomfortable. But trusting. Small sparkles drift through his room. The
      atmosphere celebrates courageous surrender.

      Words flowed. His characters made choices Noah didn't plan. Went places he didn't outline. His hands reached for control—then stopped. Breathed. Let it happen. The quill blazed. Golden threads wove through his words. The story was alive. Messy. Uncertain. Beautiful. "I can't control everything," Noah said, grinning through discomfort. "Some stories need to grow wild. And that's okay. That's trust. That's the deepest courage."
