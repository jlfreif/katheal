description: Noah returns to his desk with three unfinished stories, but this time he knows exactly what to do—choosing with confidence rather than fear, carrying the compass's lesson inside him forever.

  Noah sits cross-legged on his bed, ukulele in his lap, playing a soft melody he composed
  about his journey. On his nightstand: the sprouting acorn, a completed story notebook, a
  sketch Ellie made of the Singing Stones. Through the window, stars begin to appear. Noah
  looks peaceful, whole, different from the anxious boy who sat paralyzed by choices. He sets
  down the ukulele and picks up a fresh notebook. On the first page, he writes: "Chapter One:
  The Choice." The Whispering Woods hum in harmony.

  Noah opened the first notebook, the one he'd abandoned weeks ago. But now the story flowed
  easily—not because it was the "right" choice, but because he chose it, and that made it right.
  On his desk, Bramblebeard's acorn already sprouted a tiny silver shoot. The woods still called
  to Noah, but differently now. Not "come get lost"—but "come explore." He touched his chest
  where the compass lived inside him. Its lesson was simple: trust yourself, choose anyway, keep
  walking. Noah began a new story—not because he had to, but because he wanted to. Each word a
  choice, each choice a path forward. "You know the way now." And he did.
