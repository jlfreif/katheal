    focus: Returning to ordinary world

    visual: |
      Noah sits cross-legged on his bedroom floor in the same position as the
      opening, surrounded by notebooks and papers. He writes in his notebook with
      focused intent. The golden quill shimmers faintly through his ordinary pen.
      The room is identical but feels different. His expression is engaged and
      content, no longer restless.

      Noah's room looked exactly the same: scattered notebooks, afternoon light
      through the window, ukulele against the wall. But everything felt different.
      He picked up his pen, and somewhere inside it, the golden quill hummed with
      warmth. He opened to a fresh page and began to write.

    focus: Transformed by the journey

    visual: |
      Noah's notebook shows writing that flows naturally, the visible sentence
      reading "This is a story about learning that truth matters more than
      perfection." At the window's edge, a barely visible golden thread connects
      his world to somewhere beyond. Outside, a small bird watches with eyes
      that catch the light strangely.

      The words came easier now. Not perfect words, but true ones. Noah wrote
      about a boy who learned that honest stories mattered more than clever ones.
      Outside his window, a golden thread caught the light, so faint no one else
      would notice. But Noah noticed. And somewhere in Kathaél, his words were
      becoming real.
