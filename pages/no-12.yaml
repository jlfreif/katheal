    visual: |
      Noah sits cross-legged on his bedroom floor in the same position as the
      opening, but the crumpled papers are gone. A fresh notebook lies open before
      him. The blank page from Kathaél shimmers faintly beneath his ordinary paper.
      His expression is peaceful, curious, open.

      Noah's room looked the same: afternoon light, scattered books, ukulele against
      the wall. But the crumpled papers were gone. He'd thrown them away. Now a
      fresh notebook lay open, and beneath his ordinary paper, the glowing blank
      page hummed with warmth. He picked up his pen.

    focus: Transformed by the journey

    visual: |
      Noah writes in his notebook, but the visible sentence trails off mid-thought:
      "She opened the door and—" with empty space after it. He's smiling slightly,
      comfortable with the incompleteness. At the window's edge, a golden thread
      shimmers. Outside, a bird watches with knowing eyes.

      "She opened the door and—" Noah stopped writing. Not because he was stuck,
      but because he was curious. What would the story want to happen next? He
      left space on the page, trusting the ending would come when it was ready.
      Outside his window, a golden thread caught the light, unfinished and beautiful.
