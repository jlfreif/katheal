    visual: |
      Noah sits cross-legged on his bedroom floor, same position as the opening.
      But the crumpled papers are gone. A fresh notebook lies open before him. The
      blank page from Kathaél shimmers faintly beneath his ordinary paper. His
      expression is peaceful, curious, open. The ukulele still leans against the wall.

      Noah's room looked the same: afternoon light, scattered books, ukulele against
      the wall. But the crumpled papers were gone. "Why can't I finish one story?"
      he'd asked before. Now he smiled at the question. A fresh notebook lay open,
      the glowing page from Kathaél warm beneath his ordinary paper. He picked up
      his pen.

    visual: |
      Noah writes in his notebook, sentence trailing off mid-thought: "She opened
      the door and..." with empty space after it. He smiles slightly, comfortable
      with the incompleteness. At the window's edge, a golden thread shimmers,
      unfinished and bright. The bird from the forest watches with knowing eyes.

      "She opened the door and..." Noah stopped writing. Not stuck. Curious. What
      would the story want to happen next? He left space on the page and smiled.
      Courage wasn't knowing how things ended. It was trusting they would. Outside
      his window, a golden thread caught the light, unfinished and beautiful. Just
      like all the best beginnings.
