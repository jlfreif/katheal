      Noah's desk. The same setup as the opening. But different now. Crumpled papers still in the
      wastebasket. Laptop still open. Unfinished story on screen. Noah sits down. The golden quill
      from Kathaél rests beside his keyboard. Glowing faintly. He looks at the seventeen crossed-out
      endings. Smiles instead of frowns. His room the same. But it feels different. Less pressure.
      More possibility. His posture relaxed. His expression calm. Confident. Text in Times New Roman

      Noah sat at his desk. The same unfinished story. The seventeen failed attempts still in the wastebasket. But now they looked different. Not like failures. Like practice. The golden quill rested beside his keyboard. Getting it right mattered less than getting it true. He cracked his knuckles. Started typing.

      Noah types rapidly. Grinning. Words flow across the screen. The golden quill glows in rhythm with
      his typing. On the laptop screen, faint golden threads appear around the words. Kathaél's magic
      hasn't left him. The wastebasket holds attempt eighteen. Nineteen is going better. His ukulele
      leans nearby. Ready for celebration. Notebooks show fresh ideas. Crossed out. Improved. No shame.
      He laughs at something he writes. Completely engaged. Joyful. Small sparkles drift through his room.

      Words poured out. Messy. Imperfect. Alive. Noah made mistakes. Deleted them. Tried again. Eighteen became nineteen became twenty. Each attempt taught him something new. The quill glowed brighter. Golden threads wove through his words on screen. "Kathaél's magic lives in every brave choice," he said, grinning. "Not getting it perfect the first time. But having the guts to try again. And again. And again."
