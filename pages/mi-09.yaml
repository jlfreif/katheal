      Micah stands before the same overwhelming cascade of falling threads from spread 6,
      but his posture is different now—grounded, centered. His eyes are open but calm.
      One hand rests on his chest, feeling his own heartbeat. The chaos swirls around him
      but he's not tensed to flee or fight it. He's choosing to be present with it.

      Micah stood before the chaos again—the same cascade of threads that had overwhelmed
      him before. But this time he didn't tense to run or fight. He put one hand on his
      chest, feeling his heartbeat racing, and made a choice. "Breathe," he whispered to
      himself, just like he'd told Noah. "Just breathe." In. Hold. Out. The panic didn't
      disappear, but he didn't let it control him.

    focus: Discovering unexpected reach

    visual: |
      As Micah breathes calmly in the center of the chaos, golden light radiates outward from
      him in gentle pulses matching his breath. Threads throughout the entire clearing begin
      to stabilize, not just the ones near him—the calm ripples outward like rings on water.
      His eyes widen with wonder as he realizes his breath is affecting threads he can't even
      reach. The forest glows brighter.

      Golden light pulsed outward with each breath, spreading like ripples on water. Threads
      stabilized not just near him, but across the whole clearing. Distant threads he couldn't
      touch responded to his calm presence, his willingness to breathe through the overwhelm.
      Micah felt it then—warmth flooding through him, joy and determination that wasn't just
      his own. Someone else, somewhere in Kathaél, was being brave at the same moment. "We're
      not alone," he breathed. "None of us are alone."
