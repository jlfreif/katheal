      Micah stands before the massive central platform course, rolling his shoulders, ready to
      try again despite multiple failures. The course looms above him—complex, challenging,
      genuinely difficult. Maya offers encouragement from nearby. Noah watches with hope. Micah's
      expression shows determined persistence—he's not giving up. "Okay. Round twelve. Let's do
      this." His body language shows athletic confidence mixed with hard-won wisdom. He's learned
      something but now needs to apply it to the hardest challenge. The atmosphere shows courage
      through persistence.

      Micah stood, rolling his shoulders. "Okay. Round twelve. Let's do this." Noah raised an eyebrow. "Twelve?" Micah grinned. "Persistence is kind of my thing. Also, I really want to see if this works." He approached the course. This time he watched the light, not just the movement. Bright platforms got speed. Dim platforms got stillness. Read the light. Trust the pattern.

    focus: New approach works
    visual: |
      Micah moves through the central course like a conversation between speed and stillness.
      Sprint across a bright glowing platform—his body in full athletic motion. Then freeze
      completely on a dim platform, body perfectly still, letting it glow. Then sprint again to
      the next bright one. The rhythm is visible—fast, still, fast, still—like music. He's using
      both his parkour skills AND strategic pausing. Golden light traces his path as platforms
      activate. His expression shows focused joy—this is working! The final platform requires both
      at once—sprint to it, then freeze on it. He does. The course blazes gold. Victory through
      skill and persistence!

      Micah moved through the course like a conversation. Sprint across the bright platform. Freeze completely on the dim one, letting it glow. Sprint again. Pause. His body understood rhythm—from trombone, from parkour, from life. This was just a different kind of music. Fast then still then fast then still. He made it through ten platforms. Fifteen. Twenty. The last platform required both—sprint to it, then freeze on it. He did. The course blazed gold.
