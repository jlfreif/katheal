    visual: |
      Micah stands before the path leading to the Heart Crystal, fists clenched at his sides.
      His whole body vibrates with the urge to run toward it, to attack the problem with
      speed and energy. But his eyes are closed, and he's taking slow, deliberate breaths.
      His expression shows intense internal struggle. One foot lifts slightly, wanting to
      sprint, but he plants it back down. The wise tortoise from earlier watches from a
      distance, nodding slowly. Micah's choice is visible in every tense muscle choosing stillness.

      Micah stood at the path's edge. Every part of him screamed to run at those tangles,
      to fight them with speed and strength. But he remembered the tortoise's words: presence,
      not pressure. He closed his eyes. Breathed. Once. Twice. This wasn't giving up. This
      was the bravest thing he'd ever tried. Choosing to be still when everything in him wanted
      to move. "Okay," he whispered. "I'll try."

    focus: Discovering the missed clue through breath

    visual: |
      Micah sits perfectly still beneath the Heart Crystal, eyes closed, breathing slowly
      and deeply. His body has finally relaxed into the stillness instead of fighting it.
      Around him, golden threads drift down like gentle snow, drawn to his calm presence.
      The massive tangles near the Crystal begin to pulse in rhythm with his breathing: in,
      they tighten; out, they loosen. His breath is literally unwinding them. Soft golden
      light spreads from him in ripples with each exhale. His face shows peaceful concentration.
      The forest holds its breath with him.

      He sat. He breathed. In, slow and deep. Out, letting everything go. The threads near
      the Crystal began to pulse with his breath. In. Out. In. Out. With each exhale, the
      tangles loosened, just a little. His stillness wasn't weakness. It was its own kind
      of power. The hardest kind. The kind that took real courage. The threads unwound
      themselves, following the rhythm of his breathing. It was working.
