      Micah clings to the cliff face, eyes closed, breathing hard. He could climb down—give up,
      stay safe. Or he could trust what he's learned. The eagle's words come back: "Courage is
      climbing anyway." He opens his eyes but keeps them focused ahead—on the far end of the
      exposed ledge, on the summit beyond. Not on the drop below. His hands steady. His jaw sets.
      He's going to do this. His expression shows determined courage overcoming fear. The
      atmosphere is the moment of choosing bravery.

      Micah pressed against the cliff, heart hammering. He could climb down. Give up. Stay safe. Or... He opened his eyes. Kept them forward. On the summit. On the path ahead. Not on the drop. "Courage is climbing anyway," the eagle had said. He took a breath. One step. Just one. Then he'd see.

    visual: |
      Micah edges along the narrow exposed ledge, one careful step at a time. The wind whips
      but he doesn't look down—eyes fixed ahead on the summit, on solid ground. Each step is
      terrifying but he keeps going. And then his hand finds rock above again, a handhold, and
      he pulls himself up onto the cliff summit. He made it. Golden light explodes from the peak.
      Below, the golden tower becomes visible again, calling. He faced the heights and won. His
      expression shows triumphant joy and wonder. The atmosphere celebrates courage realized.

      Micah stepped sideways along the ledge. Wind pushed. Fear screamed. But he kept his eyes forward. One step. Another. Another. His hand found rock above. He pulled up onto the summit. Made it. Golden light blazed from the peak. Below, the golden tower appeared, calling. He'd faced the heights. Found his courage. Golden threads blazed, leading him forward. The Heart Crystal pulsed ahead, calling everyone home.
