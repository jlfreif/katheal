      Micah sits in meditation pose in the garden, eyes closed, deliberately practicing breathing
      even though his body wants to move. His hands rest on his knees, shoulders relaxed but
      alive with contained energy. Small twitches still show—this is still hard—but he's
      committed to it. Golden light glows faintly around him, responding to his choice. The
      atmosphere shows determined practice, choosing the hard thing because it matters.

      Micah sat and breathed. Just breathed. His body wanted to jump up and run, but he stayed. One breath. Then another. It was still hard. But he kept choosing it, kept practicing. The crane had said it would become instinct. He had to trust that.

      Chaos erupts in the garden—the golden speed creature returns zipping around wildly, wind
      whips up, everything designed to overwhelm and trigger Micah's frantic response. But Micah's
      eyes snap open and without thinking, he takes a breath. Just one. Automatic. His body
      centers instantly, and from that centered stillness, he moves with perfect precision and
      catches the speed creature effortlessly. Golden light explodes through the garden. His
      expression shows amazed joy—it worked without thinking! The atmosphere celebrates the
      moment skill becomes instinct.

      The speed creature returned, zipping chaotic circles, trying to trigger his old response. Micah's eyes opened. But before he moved—without thinking—he took a breath. Just one. His center held. From that stillness, he moved with perfect precision and caught the creature. He'd done it. Breath had become instinct.
