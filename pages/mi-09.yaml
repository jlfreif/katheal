      Micah stands ready to try again. The golden creature hovers ahead, faster than ever,
      challenging him. His body wants to chase immediately, to go-go-go without thinking. But he
      stops himself. Closes his eyes. Takes one deliberate breath. The crane's words come back:
      "The hardest courage is being still." He could rush ahead like always. Or he could trust
      what he's learned—that breath makes him faster, not slower. His hands steady. His mind
      clears. He's going to do this right. His expression shows determined choice. The atmosphere
      is the moment of truly committing to a new way.

      The golden creature led Micah toward a chasm crossed only by narrow beams—one wrong move and he'd fall. His body screamed to rush across, to outrun the danger. Go-go-go. But he stopped at the edge. Closed his eyes. Took one breath. The crane was right—the hardest courage wasn't moving. It was pausing first. Breathing when you wanted to rush. Even here. Especially here. He opened his eyes, centered and ready. Now he'd try.

      Micah chases the golden creature again, but this time maintaining the breath rhythm no
      matter how fast he goes. Breathe in. Vault. Breathe out. Flip. Breathe in. Climb. The
      movements flow faster and faster but always from center, always from breath. Suddenly he's
      not chasing anymore—he's flowing. He matches the creature's speed perfectly, moving beside
      it in synchronized grace. Golden light explodes from both of them. The creature laughs with
      joy. Micah found it—true speed comes from stillness, not despite it. His expression shows
      ecstatic realization. The atmosphere celebrates mastery of the paradox—moving fastest when
      centered in breath.

      Micah moved across the beams. Breathe in. Step. Breathe out. Leap to the next beam. Breathe in. Balance. The chasm yawned below. Every instinct screamed to rush, to panic, to go faster. But he breathed. Stayed centered. Moved with precision born from stillness. He crossed the entire chasm without a single stumble. The golden creature flew beside him, laughing with joy. "You found it!" Micah landed on solid ground, heart pounding but steady. Real speed came from stillness. The tower blazed ahead. The Heart Crystal pulsed, calling everyone home. Micah breathed, and flew.
