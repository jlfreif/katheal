      Noah sits on a moss-covered log in the forest library, surrounded by floating failed endings.
      Grey crossed-out attempts drift around him like dead leaves. "She found her voice in a cave."
      "Magic restored what was lost." All wrong. He stares at them, head in hands. The original
      scroll hovers before him, still unfinished, thread dim but alive. Tree branches hold other
      stories. A firefly-light pulses nearby. His face shows exhaustion and dawning realization.

      Noah stared at his failures. Every ending technically perfect. All wrong. He'd been solving the story like a math problem. But stories weren't problems. They were living things. The scroll pulsed before him. For the first time, he stopped telling it what to do. He just listened.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Noah sits very still, eyes closed, hands gentle on the story's thread. The thread glows
      brighter. The story's pages begin writing themselves. Golden words appear, flowing naturally.
      The ending emerges: "She realized her voice had never been lost. It had been waiting for her
      to stop searching and start speaking." Noah's eyes snap open in wonder. The firefly dances.

      The story whispered. Not loud. Not triumphant. Quiet and true. Words appeared. Flowing. Natural. "She realized her voice had never been lost. It had been waiting for her to stop searching and start speaking." Noah gasped. "Not my idea. The story's own truth." The thread blazed gold.
