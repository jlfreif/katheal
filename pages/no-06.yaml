    visual: |
      Noah sits on a moss-covered boulder, notebook closed beside him. His hands
      rest in his lap, empty of pen. Around him, story-threads hang frozen in the
      air. The theatrical storyteller's tangled mess is visible in the distance.
      Noah's posture shows exhaustion and defeat, but also stillness.

      Noah set down his pen. His perfect endings hadn't worked. The twist endings
      had made things worse. He was tired of forcing words onto stories that didn't
      want them. For the first time since arriving, he simply sat and watched,
      expecting nothing.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern

    visual: |
      A small golden thread hovers before Noah, and as he watches without interfering,
      words begin to form at its trailing end, writing themselves in soft light.
      The story is completing itself. His eyes widen with understanding. A deer
      watches from the grove's edge, approving.

    text: |
      The thread in front of him trembled. Then, impossibly, new words began to
      appear at its end—writing themselves. "—and she realized home had been there
      all along." The thread sealed itself, glowing bright and whole. Noah's breath
      caught. The story had known its own ending. It just needed someone to stop
      trying to write it for them.
