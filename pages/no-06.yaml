      Noah sits on a moss-covered boulder, notebook closed beside him, hands empty.
      Story-threads hang frozen around him. The storyteller's tangled mess glows
      dimly in the distance. Noah's posture shows exhaustion giving way to stillness.

      Noah collapsed onto the moss-covered boulder, completely exhausted. His notebook
      slipped from his fingers. He was too tired to pick it up. Too tired to plan.
      Too tired to fix anything. For the first time, he just... stopped. No pen. No plan.
      Just him, being honest about not understanding.

    visual: |
      A golden thread hovers before Noah, and as he watches without interfering,
      words begin forming at its trailing end, writing themselves in soft light.
      His eyes widen with understanding. A deer watches from the grove's edge.
      The completed thread glows brighter than any he's seen.

      The thread in front of him trembled. Then, impossibly, words began writing
      themselves: "...and she realized home had been there all along." The thread
      sealed itself, glowing bright and whole. Noah's breath caught. He sat up slowly,
      afraid to scare it. The thread glowed brighter and brighter until it was almost
      too beautiful to look at. "You did it yourself," he whispered. "You just needed..."
      He trailed off, understanding flooding through him. "You needed someone to stick
      around. Someone to witness it."
