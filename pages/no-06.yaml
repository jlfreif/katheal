    visual: |
      Noah sits on a moss-covered boulder in a quiet grove, finally still. His
      notebook lies closed beside him, hands resting gently on his knees, palms up.
      The theatrical diagram lies scattered and useless on the ground behind him.
      Dappled light filters through leaves. His posture has shifted from frantic
      effort to quiet observation.

      The storyteller's grand gestures had accomplished nothing. The threads didn't
      care about impressive plans or clever diagrams. Noah sat on a boulder, letting
      his breathing slow for the first time since he'd arrived. The grove was quiet,
      and he was tired of trying so hard. Maybe stopping was the answer.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern

    visual: |
      A small golden thread hovers in the air before Noah, glowing brighter as he
      watches it with soft, focused attention. The threads nearest to him pulse
      gently in rhythm with his breathing. A deer with gentle eyes stands at the
      grove's edge, bearing witness. Understanding dawns on Noah's face, his
      expression calm and present.

      The thread in front of him flickered. Noah held still, barely breathing.
      When he stopped trying to impress it, the thread glowed brighter. When he
      thought about how much he genuinely wanted to help, it pulsed warmly. His
      chest loosened. The threads didn't respond to cleverness. They responded
      to honesty.
