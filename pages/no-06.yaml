      Noah stands exhausted in the center of the library, surrounded by five different barrier-
      puzzles he's been working on. His notebook is filled with new sketches—far more detailed than
      his original story outlines. He's tried approaching them like he wrote them (failed), reverse
      engineering his own fictional logic (failed), even improvising completely new solutions
      (partial success but triggered defenses). Sweat drips down his face. His muscles ache from
      climbing. The ground keeps shaking. More barriers collapse in the distance—parts of his story
      world dying. He flips through his notebook comparing his original simple sketches to the
      complex reality. Twenty-three attempts across five locks. His story world isn't following his
      plot. It's become something more. The owl watches from above. Noah's expression shows
      exhaustion but determination—he won't give up on his own creation. The atmosphere is persistent
      effort despite being overwhelmed. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah's fifth attempt on the second barrier—failed. He dropped to the ground, breathing hard. His arms burned. His brain buzzed from tracking seven systems at once. Behind him, another barrier collapsed. More of his story world lost. He grabbed his notebook. Twenty-three attempts. His original sketches looked so simple now. "I created this world," he muttered, "but it doesn't work the way I wrote it. It's become something more."

      Noah suddenly freezes, notebook open to his original story outline. Wait. In his story, he
      wrote about ONE hero solving puzzles. But the symbols on the locks—Bear, Hunter, Arrow—they're
      telling a story together across multiple barriers. His world took his simple idea and expanded
      it. The locks aren't separate puzzles like he planned. They're one giant interconnected story
      that Kathaél created from his original concept. He scrambles up, looking at all the visible
      locks throughout the library. His story world built something far more beautiful and complex
      than what he imagined. You have to solve them as a group, watching how changes in one affect
      the others. It's the hardest, most amazing puzzle he's ever seen—and he inspired it, even if
      he didn't fully create it. His expression shows wonder and breakthrough excitement. The
      atmosphere celebrates the creator discovering his creation surpassed his vision. Text in Times

      Noah's eyes caught on the symbols. Bear. Hunter. Arrow. Three different locks telling one story. "Wait..." He looked at his outline. He'd written about separate puzzles. But Kathaél had connected them—his world had grown beyond his imagination. The locks weren't isolated. They were one massive story his world had built from his simple idea. More complex and beautiful than he'd planned. "Oh," he breathed, grinning through exhaustion. "My world is smarter than my outline. Let's solve what Kathaél actually created."
