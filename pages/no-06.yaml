      Noah sits exhausted in the forest library, surrounded by stories he tried to "help" that are
      still trapped. His detailed plans lie crumpled around him. His control systems failed. He
      watches a completely unchained story float nearby—one that a writer simply released without
      controlling. It seems chaotic at first, wandering, trying different paths. Noah's instinct
      screams to guide it, direct it, control it. But he forces himself to just watch. His
      expression shows intense discomfort with not controlling. The atmosphere is the agony of
      letting go. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah watched a free story drift and wander. No outline. No control. It tried one path, changed its mind, tried another. Messy. Uncertain. Every fiber of Noah's being wanted to grab it, guide it, tell it the right way. He clenched his fists. Just watch. Don't control.

      The wild story Noah watched suddenly finds its own path. Not random—organic. It discovered
      something beautiful Noah's control never could have planned. Characters made choices Noah
      wouldn't have allowed, but they fit perfectly. The story glows brilliant gold, healthy and
      alive. Other unchained stories weave around it in complex, unplanned harmony. Noah stares
      in wonder. Freedom didn't mean chaos. It meant the story finding its own truth. His
      expression shows revelation. The atmosphere celebrates emergent order beyond control. Text

      The story found its way. Not random. Not chaotic. Its own way. Beautiful and strange and right. Choices Noah never would have planned. Moments Noah never would have controlled. But perfect. Golden and alive. "Oh," Noah breathed. "Freedom doesn't mean chaos. It means trust. Stories know their own truth better than I do."
