      Noah sits exhausted in the forest library, surrounded by stories he tried to "help" that are
      still trapped. His detailed plans lie crumpled around him. His perfect solutions failed. He
      watches a story float nearby—one that a writer simply let try different things. It tries one path,
      fails, adjusts, tries another. Fails again. Tries a third way. Noah's instinct screams to
      tell it the right answer, skip the mistakes, get it right the first time. But he forces himself to just watch. His
      expression shows intense discomfort with watching failure. The atmosphere is the agony of
      accepting that mistakes are part of learning. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah watched a story try and fail and try again. It tried one path—wrong. Tried another—still wrong. Tried a third. Messy. Uncertain. Every fiber of Noah's being wanted to tell it the right answer, save it from mistakes, help it get it right the first time. He clenched his fists. Just watch. Let it learn through trying.

      The story Noah watched suddenly finds its path—on the seventh try. Not perfect from the start—earned through
      persistence. It discovered something beautiful through all those attempts. Each failure taught it something.
      Each mistake led closer to the answer. The story glows brilliant gold, healthy and alive. Other stories
      weave around it, all marked by their own journeys of trying and failing and trying again. Noah stares
      in wonder. Success didn't come from getting it right the first time. It came from not giving up. His
      expression shows revelation. The atmosphere celebrates the courage of persistence. Text

      The story found its way—on the seventh try. Not through getting it perfect from the start. Through trying and failing and trying again. Each mistake taught it something. Each failure brought it closer. Golden and alive. "Oh," Noah breathed. "Success doesn't come from getting it right the first time. It comes from not giving up after mistakes. From trying again."
