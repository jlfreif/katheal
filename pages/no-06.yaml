      A circle of failed attempts surrounds Noah in the library. Floating around him are multiple
      versions of endings, all crossed out or faded to grey: "She found her voice in a cave,"
      "Her voice returned when she sang," "Magic restored what was lost." Noah sits in the center,
      head in hands, staring at the pile of beautiful but wrong endings. The original story hovers
      before him, still unfinished, its thread dim but not dead. His expression shows exhaustion
      and dawning realization. A small firefly-like light hovers near the story, pulsing gently
      in its own rhythm. The atmosphere is one of surrounded-by-failure but approaching breakthrough.

      Noah stared at his failed attempts floating around him in the library. Every ending he'd written was technically perfect but completely wrong. He'd been trying to solve the story like a math problem, finding the answer he thought it needed. But stories weren't problems. They were living things. The unfinished scroll pulsed in front of him. For the first time, he stopped trying to tell it what to do. He just listened.

      Noah sits very still, eyes closed, hands resting gently on the story's thread. The thread
      glows brighter, responding to his listening rather than his directing. Around him, the
      story's pages begin to write themselves—words appearing in shimmering gold, flowing naturally
      from what came before. The ending emerges organically, surprising but perfect: "She realized
      her voice had never been lost. It had been waiting for her to stop searching and start
      speaking." Noah's eyes snap open in wonder. The firefly light dances joyfully. Other stories
      in the library brighten slightly, responding to this success. His expression shows amazed
      understanding.

      The story whispered what it needed. Not a loud, triumphant ending like he'd planned, but something quieter and truer. Words appeared on the page, flowing naturally. "She realized her voice had never been lost. It had been waiting for her to stop searching and start speaking." Noah gasped. "That's it. Not my idea, but the story's own truth." The thread blazed gold.
