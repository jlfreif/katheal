      Noah sits exhausted among the dying stories, surrounded by books he tried to "help" that are
      now wrapped in even more chains. His hands shake. Everything he does makes it worse. The owl
      watches patiently. Nearby, Noah spots one story that's still alive—truly alive, glowing with
      vibrant color and energy. It has no chains. Noah crawls over to it, desperate to understand.
      He opens the book. The pages are messy. The hero takes a wrong path—realizes it's wrong—
      backtracks—tries a different way. Fails. Tries again. Makes mistakes. Learns. Stumbles forward.
      Nothing is perfectly plotted. The story is uncertain about what happens next. And it's
      beautiful. Alive. Breathing. Noah stares. Every instinct screams to "fix" it, to show the
      character the right path, to delete the failures. His hands hover over the pages, trembling.
      The atmosphere is agonizing restraint. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah sat among the dying stories he'd "helped." Everything he touched got worse. His hands shook. Nearby—a story that glowed with life. Really alive. No chains. He grabbed it, desperate. Opened the pages. The hero tried a path—wrong. Backtracked. Tried another—failed. A third attempt. Messy. Uncertain. Learning through mistakes. Noah's fingers twitched. Every instinct screamed: fix it. Show the right way. Delete the failures. Make it perfect. His hands hovered over the messy pages, trembling. "Don't," the owl whispered.

      Noah forces his hands down. Doesn't touch. Just watches. The story continues—the hero tries a
      fourth approach, fifth, makes mistakes, learns from each failure, stumbles forward. And
      suddenly—breakthrough. Not because someone told them the answer. Because they tried enough
      wrong things to figure out the right thing. The story blazes brilliant gold, completely alive.
      Other stories around it that were freed the same way—allowed to fail, allowed to try—weave
      through the air in joyous spirals. Each one different. Each one messy. Each one earned through
      trial and error. None of them perfect. All of them alive. Noah's eyes widen with revelation.
      "They don't need me to plot their path," he breathes. "They need me to let go. To let them try
      and fail and try again. That's how stories live." His expression shows breakthrough
      understanding mixed with fear—can he actually do that? The atmosphere celebrates earned
      freedom. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah watched. Didn't touch. Didn't fix. Just watched the story try and fail and try again. Fifth attempt. Sixth. Learning from each mistake. And then—click. The hero found the answer. Not because Noah gave it to them. Because they tried enough wrong things to discover the right thing. The story blazed gold, fully alive. Around it, other freed stories danced—all messy, all imperfect, all trying and failing and living. "They don't need my perfect plotting," Noah whispered. "They need permission to fail." The owl nodded. "Now you understand. Can you let go?"
