    visual: |
      Noah sits on a moss-covered boulder, notebook closed beside him, hands empty.
      Story-threads hang frozen around him. The storyteller's tangled mess glows
      dimly in the distance. Noah's posture shows exhaustion giving way to stillness.

      Noah closed his notebook. His perfect endings hadn't worked. The twist
      endings made things worse. "I'm tired of forcing words onto stories that
      don't want them." For the first time since arriving, he just sat and watched.
      No pen. No plan. Just him, being honest about not having answers.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern

    visual: |
      A golden thread hovers before Noah, and as he watches without interfering,
      words begin forming at its trailing end, writing themselves in soft light.
      His eyes widen with understanding. A deer watches from the grove's edge.
      The completed thread glows brighter than any he's seen.

      The thread in front of him trembled. Then, impossibly, words began writing
      themselves: "...and she realized home had been there all along." The thread
      sealed itself, glowing bright and whole. "Oh." Noah's voice came out a
      whisper. "They know their own endings. They just need someone to be present.
      Someone honest about not having all the answers."
