      Ellie opens her palm to reveal a small charm: a feather woven with grass and string, decorated
      with tiny sky-moth wings that shimmer iridescent blue and gold. It's simple but beautiful—
      clearly handmade with care. Noah takes it gently, studying the delicate work. Ellie watches
      his face. "You don't have to know the whole path," she says softly. "Just the next step.
      This helps me feel brave. Maybe it can help you too."

      The feather charm glowed faintly in Noah's palm—sky-moth wings catching the last light.
      "You don't have to know the whole path," Ellie whispered. "Just the next step." Noah's
      eyes welled slightly. "Thank you."

      Noah and Ellie sit together as gentle wind sweeps across the cliff—steady, warm, like an
      embrace. Noah holds the feather charm close to his heart. His posture has changed—shoulders
      a little straighter, breathing easier. Beside him, his compass begins to glow brighter again,
      as if responding to his renewed calm. Ellie leans her head on his shoulder. The sky stretches
      before them—vast but no longer overwhelming. The wind carries possibility.

      They sat as gentle winds embraced them both. Noah tucked the charm into his pocket, feeling
      its warmth. His compass pulsed—not commanding, but encouraging. "I can try again," Noah said
      quietly. Ellie smiled. "That's all you ever have to do."
