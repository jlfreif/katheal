theme_description: |
  Both Elise and Noah face parallel challenges where their progress is real but incomplete.
  Each persists through difficulty, getting closer to their goal but recognizing
  something essential is still missing. The lantern motif symbolizes their flickering
  but enduring determination.

# Symbolic motif - appears in both character pages
symbolic_motif:
  name: flickering_lantern
  description: A magical lantern whose flame responds to persistence and trust
  meaning: Light that nearly goes out but keeps burning when courage persists
  visual_cues:
    - Lantern flame dims when character doubts
    - Brightens when character perseveres
    - Never fully extinguishes as long as they keep trying
    - Warm golden glow that pulses with determination

# Scenario variants - how each character experiences the mirrored theme
scenario_variants:
  - character_code: el
    location: A winding path through dense forest
    challenge_description: |
      Elise follows a path that keeps shifting and changing. Just when she thinks
      she's found the way, it dissolves and reforms. Her lantern guides her, but
      its light flickers with every moment of doubt.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A small lantern floats ahead of her on the path. When she trusts and follows,
      it glows steady. When she hesitates or second-guesses, it dims. But it never
      fully goes out.
    emotional_arc: Doubt → Trust → Progress (incomplete)

  - character_code: no
    location: A library of unfinished stories with moving shelves
    challenge_description: |
      Noah searches for the right story to complete, but the library reshapes itself
      constantly. His lantern illuminates different sections, but just as he finds
      something promising, the shelves shift. He must persist despite the instability.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern sits on his table, its flame flickering as the library changes around
      him. When he focuses on one story at a time instead of trying to understand
      everything, the flame brightens. But the solution still eludes him.
    emotional_arc: Frustration → Focus → Progress (incomplete)

# Spread alignment - must match across all books
spread_alignment:
  spread_number: 7
  story_beat: "Rising stakes: almost works"
  hook: Success is close but incomplete, with a detail revealing what's still needed.
  payoff: What's missing is revealed to be distant or difficult to reach.

# Connection to world themes
world_connection: |
  The flickering lantern represents the Heart Crystal's response to persistence.
  Even when solutions aren't complete, the act of continuing with trust keeps
  the light alive. Both characters are learning that progress doesn't require
  perfect understanding - just honest effort.
