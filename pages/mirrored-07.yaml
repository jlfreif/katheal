beat: "Rising stakes: almost works"

shared_theme_key: persistence_through_near_success

theme_description: |
  Both Noah and Elise experience the frustration of almost succeeding but not quite.
  They discover that persistence through near-misses requires a different kind of
  courage than starting fresh.

symbolic_motif:
  name: flickering_candle
  description: A candle flame that wavers between bright and dim, never quite going out
  meaning: Hope that persists even when success feels uncertain

scenario_variants:
  - character_code: no
    location: A library of stories where endings keep changing before he can grasp them
    challenge_description: |
      Noah finds himself in a place where he can almost complete a story, but the ending
      shifts away each time he thinks he has it. He must learn that not controlling the
      outcome doesn't mean giving up.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A candle flame flickers beside him, dimming when he tries to force a specific ending,
      brightening when he trusts the story's own pattern. The flame never goes out, teaching
      him that persistence doesn't mean control.

  - character_code: el
    location: A performance hall where dancers almost complete their choreography but freeze before the finale
    challenge_description: |
      Elise watches performances that get so close to completion but stop short. She realizes
      that her fear of imperfect endings has been holding back both her and the performers.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A candle illuminates the stage, flickering lower when Elise holds back from the final
      movement. When she commits to the ending even without knowing if it will be perfect,
      the flame burns steady and bright.
