      Micah stands at the entrance to the still garden, every muscle tense, body already fidgeting
      and twitching. The garden is beautiful—soft moss, gentle stream, wind chimes that haven't
      moved in years, stone benches positioned for meditation. Everything is peaceful and
      deliberate. Micah's restless energy looks completely out of place here, chaotic against
      the calm. He tries to stand still but his feet shuffle, his hands twitch, his body vibrates
      with need to move. His expression shows genuine struggle—this is torture for him. The
      atmosphere is one of fighting against nature, resistance creating suffering.

      Micah stepped into the garden of stillness and immediately wanted to run back out. Everything was so quiet. So still. He tried to stand still. His feet shuffled. His hands twitched. Being still felt impossible, like trying not to breathe.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Micah forces himself to take one deep breath—just one, like the crane taught. His eyes
      close. His body stops fighting for just that moment. As he breathes, golden light floods
      through him, more power than he's ever felt from all his running and jumping combined. The
      garden responds, wind chimes ring once with perfect clarity, the stream sparkles, everything
      glows. When he opens his eyes, he feels centered and calm but also energized in a new way.
      His expression shows amazed discovery. The atmosphere transforms from resistance to
      revelation.

      Micah closed his eyes. Took one breath. Just one, slow and deep. Golden light flooded through him. More powerful than all his frantic running. The garden rang like a bell. Breath wasn't weakness. It was strength. Pause wasn't losing. It was gathering power.
