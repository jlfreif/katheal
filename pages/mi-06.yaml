      Micah stands at the entrance to the still garden, every muscle tense, body already fidgeting
      and twitching. The garden is beautiful—soft moss, gentle stream, wind chimes that haven't
      moved in years, stone benches positioned for meditation. Everything is peaceful and
      deliberate. Micah's restless energy looks completely out of place here, chaotic against
      the calm. He tries to stand still but his feet shuffle, his hands twitch, his body vibrates
      with need to move. His expression shows genuine struggle—this is torture for him. The
      atmosphere is one of fighting against nature, resistance creating suffering.

      Micah stepped into the garden of stillness and immediately wanted to run back out. Everything was so quiet. So still. He tried to stand still like the crane taught. His feet shuffled. His hands twitched. His whole body screamed to move. Being still felt impossible, like trying not to breathe.

      Micah forces himself to take one deep breath—just one, like the crane taught. His eyes
      close. His body stops fighting for just that moment. As he breathes in slowly and breathes
      out, golden light floods through him, more power than he's ever felt from all his running
      and jumping combined. The garden responds—wind chimes ring once with perfect clarity, the
      stream sparkles, flowers bloom. When he opens his eyes, he feels centered and calm but also
      energized in a completely new way. His expression shows amazed discovery. The atmosphere
      transforms from resistance to revelation—stillness isn't weakness, it's power.

      Micah closed his eyes. Took one breath. Just one, slow and deep like the crane showed. Golden light flooded through him—more powerful than all his frantic running combined. The garden rang like a bell. Wind chimes sang. Breath wasn't weakness. It was strength. Pause wasn't stopping. It was gathering power to move even faster.
