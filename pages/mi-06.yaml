      Micah and Noah working together on a platform course. Micah handles the physical obstacles—
      jumping, vaulting, climbing—while Noah calls out patterns and warnings from below. "Left!
      No, wait, right!" They're almost in sync, working as a team. But then the platforms shift
      again unexpectedly. Both boys fall, landing in a heap. Micah looks frustrated, hanging from
      a beam. "It keeps CHANGING!" Noah sits below surrounded by his notes, frowning at the
      patterns. His expression shows sudden realization. The atmosphere shows teamwork and the
      frustration of a puzzle that won't stay solved.

      Micah and Noah tackled a course together. Micah handled the physical obstacles while Noah called out patterns he'd spotted. They worked in rhythm—Micah jumping, Noah directing. "Left! No, wait, right!" They almost had it. Then the course shifted again. They both fell. Micah groaned. "It keeps CHANGING!" Noah frowned at his notes. "Unless... what if changing is the point?"

    visual: |
      Micah stands on a platform, testing Noah's theory. He approaches a platform slowly,
      deliberately—it stays stable longer, glowing brighter. He pauses on it completely still—
      it glows even more. Then he moves quickly to the next platform—the pattern holds! The
      platforms respond to how he moves. Bright platforms want speed. Dim platforms want stillness.
      Micah's expression shows excited discovery—understanding dawning. Noah watches from below,
      pointing at the glowing patterns forming. Golden light traces the path. The atmosphere
      celebrates breakthrough—they've cracked the code!

      Micah tested it. He approached the next platform slowly. It stayed stable longer. He paused on it completely still. It glowed brighter. Then he moved quickly to the next. The pattern held. "That's it!" Noah said. "It's not about being fast or slow. It's about knowing when to do each." Micah grinned. "Fast isn't always fastest. Like the light said." Strategic stillness. That was the trick.
