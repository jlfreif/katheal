      Micah stands at the cliff base, remembering his freeze on the tower. Looking down had
      triggered the fear—seeing all that empty space, feeling how far there was to fall. His
      hands are already trembling at the memory. The cliff rises above him, solid and rough. He
      could try again, but if he looks down again, he'll freeze again. There has to be a different
      way. The eagle's words echo: "Eyes forward, not down." He takes a breath, looking up at
      the summit instead of imagining the drop. His expression shows thoughtful realization. The
      atmosphere is the moment before breakthrough.

      Micah stood before the cliff. Last time he'd looked down and frozen. The fear lived down there—in the empty space, in the distance to fall. But the eagle had said, "Eyes forward." What if he only looked up? Only looked at where he was going, not where he might fall?

      Micah starts climbing, deliberately keeping his eyes on the rock ahead—the next handhold,
      the next foothold, the summit above. Not down. Never down. He climbs ten feet. Fifteen.
      Twenty. His hands find holds, his feet push up, his body moves with growing confidence. The
      fear that lived "below" can't touch him if he doesn't look there. He focuses only on the
      next move up, the rock solid under his hands. The cliff glows golden in response, celebrating
      his courage. He's doing it—really climbing without freezing. His expression shows surprised
      joy and building confidence. The atmosphere celebrates the power of focused attention
      overriding fear.

      Micah grabbed the first hold and climbed. Eyes on the next grip. Hands pulling up. Feet pushing up. Ten feet. Twenty. He didn't look down. Didn't let himself. Only looked at where he was going. The cliff blazed gold under his hands. Fear couldn't catch him if he didn't look at it. He was climbing. Really climbing. The summit called above.
