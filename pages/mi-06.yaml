    visual: |
      Micah has collapsed onto the ground, sprawled on his back, completely exhausted. His
      chest heaves as he gasps for air. Around him, the whirlwind continues but he's too
      tired to move anymore. Sweat drips down his face. His limbs feel like lead. The
      hummingbird has zipped away to bother someone else. For the first time in the story,
      Micah is completely, utterly still, not by choice but by necessity. His eyes are closed.
      The chaotic threads continue their frantic dance above him.

      Micah couldn't move anymore. His legs gave out and he collapsed, breathing so hard his
      lungs burned. The hummingbird buzzed off to find faster prey. He lay there, forced into
      stillness for the first time in his life. Every muscle screamed. His heart hammered.
      Moving faster hadn't helped. It had only made him too tired to help at all.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern

    visual: |
      Micah lies still on the ground, eyes now open and watching. Above him, the chaotic
      threads are beginning to slow their frantic movement. As his breathing calms, the
      threads calm too. One thread drifts down toward his outstretched hand, moving gently
      instead of wildly. His expression shows dawning wonder and realization. The whirlwind
      around the clearing starts to ease. Golden light filters through more peacefully. The
      correlation is clear: his stillness creates their stillness.

      As he lay there catching his breath, something changed. The wild threads above him
      started to slow. His breathing slowed. The threads slowed with it. One floated down
      to hover above his hand, calm and gentle. Micah's eyes went wide. They weren't matching
      his speed anymore. They were matching his stillness. The pattern clicked. Stop moving.
      Start breathing. That was the answer.
