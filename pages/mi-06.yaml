    visual: |
      Dozens of golden threads suddenly cascade down around Micah like falling stars, creating
      chaos in the air. His body tenses instinctively, muscles coiling to jump, run, react—
      his usual response to chaos. But his eyes are wide, recognizing this is too much for
      frantic action. The threads swirl in confusing patterns, some dimming rapidly. His
      fists clench. The overwhelm is visible in his posture.

      Threads rained down like falling stars—too many, too fast. Micah's body coiled to
      react, to run, to catch them all at once. His heart hammered. His muscles screamed
      "Move! Now!" The chaos swirled around him, and he felt that familiar panic rising:
      everything happening at once, too much to handle, no time to think.

    focus: Discovering the power of pause

    visual: |
      Micah stands in the center of the falling threads with eyes closed, one hand on his
      chest, taking a deep, visible breath. Everything around him seems to slow slightly—
      the threads' fall becomes more graceful, less chaotic. His face is calm, concentrated.
      As he breathes out slowly, several threads near him stabilize mid-air, beginning to
      glow brighter. The moth from before circles him approvingly.

      Then—almost without thinking—Micah closed his eyes and breathed. One deep breath in.
      The chaos didn't stop, but something inside him settled. He breathed out slowly, and
      when he opened his eyes, the falling threads looked different: not random, but patterned.
      His breath created space between the panic and the action. "Whoa," he whispered. In
      that pause, he could see what to do. Three threads stabilized in his calm presence.
      The breath wasn't stopping him from moving—it was helping him move better.
