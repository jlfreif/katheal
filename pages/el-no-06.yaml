  The ground trembles gently. Behind the spiral of Singing Stones, a massive archway covered
  in flowering vines reveals itself—previously hidden, now glowing with the same golden light.
  The archway frames a new path forward, mysterious but inviting. Noah and Ellie stand side
  by side, victorious, their hands still glowing faintly. Ellie grins proudly. Noah's expression
  shows revelation—he couldn't have done this alone, and that's not a weakness.

  Noah and Ellie arrived at the same heartbeat, from opposite sides of the spiral. The Singing
  Stones grew louder, as if welcoming them both. "You hear it too?" Noah gasped. The stones sang
  their riddle in light and sound. Noah heard patterns like a map. Ellie heard rhythms like a
  heartbeat. "I think," Noah said slowly, "we need both." Ellie tapped out her rhythm on one
  central stone while Noah pressed the stones in sequence following his map pattern. The stones
  lit up in response—golden light flowing between them in perfect synchronization. "It's working!"
  Ellie laughed. Noah felt something click into place—not just in the puzzle, but in his understanding.
  A hidden archway bloomed to life, vines parting like a curtain. Noah stared at Ellie, amazed.
  "I could never have solved that alone." Ellie squeezed his hand. "That's what makes it better."
