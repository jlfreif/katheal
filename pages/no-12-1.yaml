      Noah sits at his desk again—the same wooden desk, the same round window, the same scattered
      papers. But everything feels different. He looks at the three unfinished story notebooks with
      new eyes—not as wrong choices, but as possibilities waiting. His hand rests gently on one,
      feeling which one calls to him now. No fear. No panic. Just quiet knowing. Afternoon light
      streams through the window, warm and golden.

      Noah opened the first notebook, the one he'd abandoned weeks ago. But now the story flowed
      easily—not because it was the "right" choice, but because he chose it, and that made it right.

      Noah writes with confidence, his pen moving steadily across the page. On his desk, Bramblebeard's
      acorn sits in a small pot with fresh soil, already sprouting a tiny silver shoot. On his windowsill,
      paperbirds visit, their wings flashing colors. His blog is open on his laptop, a new post titled:
      "The Cartographer's Compass: A Story About Getting Lost On Purpose." His expression shows peace
      and purpose. He's home, but he carries the adventure inside him.

      Noah wrote about the compass, about choosing paths without knowing where they lead, about trust.
      The words poured out effortlessly. Outside, the Whispering Woods whispered approval. He smiled.
      This was just the beginning.
