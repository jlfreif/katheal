      A mischievous sparkle-fox darts through the Library, scrambling all the constellation pieces
      Mona carefully placed! It giggles as it swaps stars, hides connecting lines, rearranges patterns
      in the air. Mona chases after it, toddler-running with determination through aisles of glowing
      books. She's breathing hard but grinning—this is like a game of chase! She watches its zigzag
      pattern between the ancient trees. "Why does it go left-left-right?" she asks herself, investigating
      while running. The fox sparkles and dodges around floating scrolls. Other creatures cheer her on.
      The Library pulses with energy. Her expression shows focused excitement—using her mind while her
      body moves fast. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      A fox messed up the stars! It giggled. Mona ran after it! Run, run, run! "Why does it zigzag?" she asked. Left-left-right. Left-left-right. She saw the pattern! But running was hard!

      Mona predicts the fox's next move—left-left-RIGHT!—and dives, catching it in a gentle hug between
      stacks of floating books. The fox squeaks in surprise, then laughs and hands her a golden crystal
      star. "You earned it!" it says. Mona sits down on the Library floor, breathing hard, holding the
      precious star. The constellation pedestal in the distance still has incomplete patterns. This star
      could complete it—but the pedestal shows three spots where the star might connect. No clues which
      one is right. Mona's tired but determined. She examines the spots carefully through the Library
      air. This is the hardest puzzle yet—no obvious pattern to investigate. Her expression shows fatigue
      but focus. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Left-left-RIGHT! Mona caught it! The fox laughed. Gave her a gold star. "You got it!" Mona sat down. So tired! Where did the star go? Three spots. Which one was right? Mona didn't know.
