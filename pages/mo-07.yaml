      The playground coming alive around Mona. Swings swinging with laughing children, slide
      working smoothly, sandbox toys moving, seesaw going up and down. Mona claps her hands in
      delight, bouncing on her toes, huge smile on her face. Golden threads connect all the toys
      she's helped wake up, glowing bright and happy. Other children play joyfully. Her expression
      shows proud happiness. The atmosphere is celebratory and bright. Almost everything is working.
      Almost everything is fixed.

      The playground woke up around Mona. Swings flying! Slide smooth! Sandbox toys digging! She'd
      tried each one slowly and patiently, just like the turtle said. And it worked! Children
      played and laughed everywhere. Mona clapped her hands, spinning in a happy circle. "I did
      it!" She'd been brave enough to try new things, one at a time. The playground was almost
      all better.

      Mona's celebration stops as she notices one toy still dark and frozen—a very tall, very
      twisty slide at the far end of the playground. It looms high above everything else, spiraling
      and turning in ways that look scary even to older kids. No one is near it. It waits alone,
      unlit, needing someone brave enough to try. Mona stands looking up at it, her little neck
      craned back, one hand holding her bunny tight. Her expression shows a mix of determination
      and real fear—this is different from the other toys. This is actually scary. The atmosphere
      shifts from celebration to challenge. The big test waits.

      Almost. One toy stayed dark. The very tall, very twisty slide at the far end, bigger and
      scarier than anything Mona had tried yet. She walked toward it slowly, bunny gripped tight.
      The other slides had been easy. This one was actually scary, even for big kids. Her tummy
      felt very fluttery. "Too high," she whispered. But it needed someone to try it. Someone
      had to be brave enough.
