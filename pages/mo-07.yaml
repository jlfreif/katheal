      Mona stands by her growing tower with one special block left—a beautiful golden round block that
      glows brightly. It's the top piece! But when she places it on the tower, it wobbles... rolls...
      and falls off. PLOP! She picks it up and tries again. Places it carefully. It wobbles... rolls...
      falls off again! PLOP! "Why does it roll?" she asks, tilting her head. She tries a third time,
      placing it in a different spot. It wobbles dangerously. Other creatures watch nervously. The tower
      is almost complete but this last block won't stay! She's breathing hard from trying over and over.

      One block left! A gold round block! Mona put it on top. It wobbled. It rolled. PLOP! It fell! She tried again. PLOP! Fell again! "Why does it roll?" she asked. So close! But it kept falling!

      Mona sits down on the Library floor, breathing hard, holding the golden round block. She's tried
      it so many times! She looks up at her tower. It's tall and beautiful, glowing softly, but incomplete
      without the top block. She examines the top of the tower carefully. There are three different spots
      where the golden block might balance—left side, middle, or right side. But every time she tries,
      it rolls off before she can see which spot is right! No clues which way to try. Mona's tired but
      determined. She looks at the three spots. This is the hardest part yet—no obvious way to investigate.
      Her expression shows fatigue but focus.

      Mona sat down. So tired! The tower was so pretty! But not done. The gold block had three spots to go. Left? Middle? Right? It rolled too fast! She couldn't tell! Which spot was right? Mona didn't know.
