    focus: The setback hits hard

    visual: |
      Mona stands at the base of a steep cliff, looking up at a glowing path
      that spirals upward far above her head. The cliff is made of smooth,
      colorful stones but they're spaced too far apart for her to reach. Her
      glowing block, which has been bright throughout her journey, now flickers
      weakly in her hand. She looks very small against the massive cliff face.
      The sky above is starting to dim. Faded creatures gather behind her,
      watching hopefully, but Mona's shoulders slump.

      The path went up. Way, way up. Mona tilted her head back until her neck
      hurt, but she still couldn't see the top. Big kids could climb this.
      Grown-ups could climb this. But Mona? Her legs were so short. Her arms
      were so little. She tried to reach the first handhold, stretching on
      her tiptoes, but her fingers didn't even come close. The glowing block
      in her hand flickered. Dimmed. It was getting tired too.

    focus: Moment of deepest doubt

    visual: |
      Mona sits down on the ground, the flickering block cradled in her lap.
      For the first time in her journey, she looks small and defeated. Her
      head is down, curly hair hiding her face. Around her, the world continues
      to fade—flowers wilting, colors draining, even the butterfly from earlier
      losing some of its blue. A tear rolls down Mona's cheek. The turtle from
      the garden approaches slowly. The light in Kathaél grows dimmer.

      Mona sat down hard, her block flickering in her lap like a tiny heartbeat
      getting slower. She'd tried so many new things. She'd jumped the big jumps.
      She'd helped the butterfly. She'd painted with Maya and sat gentle with
      Elise. But this cliff was too much for someone so small. A tear rolled
      down her cheek. "Too little," she whispered. "I'm just too little." Maybe
      trying wasn't always enough. Maybe sometimes you could be too small to help,
      no matter how brave you were.
