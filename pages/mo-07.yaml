      Mona moves through a series of magical tests with growing confidence. At a dark tunnel: she
      questions if it's safe, sees light at the end, then acts by walking through. At a locked
      door: she questions how to open it, spots a key nearby, then acts by using it. At a rickety
      bridge: she questions its strength, tests with one foot, then acts by crossing carefully.
      Golden threads brighten with each balanced choice. Other creatures cheer. The garden is
      coming alive around her. Her expression shows proud competence. The atmosphere celebrates
      her growing mastery.

      Mona balanced it perfectly. Dark tunnel? Question: is it safe? See light at end. Act: walk through. Locked door? Question: how to open? See key. Act: use it. Rickety bridge? Question: will it hold? Test one step. Act: cross carefully. The garden blazed gold.

      Mona reaches the final challenge: a seed pod that needs planting to restore the Heart Crystal.
      But this one is different—there's no obvious answer. No light at the end of the tunnel, no
      visible key, no way to test it first. She has to choose between questioning more (what if
      it's the wrong spot? what if it won't grow?) or acting on instinct (just plant it and trust).
      Mona stands frozen, paralyzed by the lack of clarity. Other creatures wait. The seed pod
      pulses in her hands. Her expression shows genuine uncertainty. The atmosphere shows the
      hardest moment: when you can't know for sure and must choose anyway.

      The final test: a seed that could restore everything. The Heart Crystal's cracks pulsed in the distance, waiting for this final piece. But where to plant it? No clues. No certainty. Plant it wrong and the cracks would spread forever. Question more? Or just trust and act? Mona stood frozen, paralyzed. Her hands shook. What if she chose wrong? What if wrong meant losing everything?
