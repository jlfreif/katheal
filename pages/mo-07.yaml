      Mona sits in a clearing filled with golden threads that now glow brightly around her,
      floating and dancing in the air like happy ribbons. She laughs and claps her hands as
      threads spiral around her, their light warm and strong. A dozen threads have unwound
      themselves simply from her presence and fearless joy. Small creatures have gathered to
      watch: rabbits, birds, a deer at the clearing's edge. Her face radiates pure delight.
      The forest seems brighter, more alive.

      All around Mona, threads were waking up. They swirled and danced, glowing like sunshine.
      She laughed and they spun faster, responding to her joy. Everywhere she went, just being
      herself made the threads remember how to shine. Animals gathered to watch the tiny girl
      who fixed things without even trying. She was so happy she could help.

    focus: Realizing something is missing

    visual: |
      Mona looks up at the massive Heart Crystal visible through the trees, its facets towering
      far above her. Thick golden threads connect to the Crystal's highest points, but these
      remain dim and lifeless despite all her progress. Her small hand reaches upward, but the
      distance is impossibly vast for a two-year-old. Her expression shows determination mixed
      with the first hint of uncertainty. The contrast between the glowing threads around her
      and the dark threads above is stark. Stars begin to appear in the twilight sky.

      But then Mona looked up. Way, way up. The biggest threads of all connected to the
      Heart Crystal high above the trees. Those threads were still dark. She reached toward
      them, but they were too far away, even standing on her tiptoes. Her smile faded a
      little. How could she help the threads she couldn't reach?
