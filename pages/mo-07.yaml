      A mischievous sparkle-fox darts through the garden, scrambling all the puzzle pieces Mona
      carefully placed! It giggles as it swaps symbols, hides keys, rearranges patterns. Mona
      chases after it, toddler-running with determination. She's breathing hard but grinning—this
      is like a game of chase! She watches its zigzag pattern. "Why does it go left-left-right?"
      she asks herself, investigating while running. The fox sparkles and dodges. Other creatures
      cheer her on. The garden pulses with energy. Her expression shows focused excitement—using
      her mind while her body moves fast.

"Why does it zigzag?" she asked, watching its pattern. Left-left-right. Left-left-right. She was figuring it out while running! Her lungs burned but she grinned.

      Mona predicts the fox's next move—left-left-RIGHT!—and dives, catching it in a gentle hug.
      The fox squeaks in surprise, then laughs and hands her a golden seed pod. "You earned it!"
      it says. Mona sits down, breathing hard, holding the precious seed. The garden is almost
      restored, but the Heart Crystal in the distance still has cracks. This seed could fix it—
      but the ground ahead shows three spots that look identical. No clues which one is right.
      Mona's tired but determined. She examines the spots carefully. This is the hardest puzzle yet—
      no obvious pattern to investigate. Her expression shows fatigue but focus.

      Left-left-RIGHT! Mona caught the fox in a hug. It laughed and gave her a golden seed. "You earned it!" Mona sat down hard, breathing fast. Tired. But not done. Ahead: three identical spots to plant the seed. The Heart Crystal's cracks pulsed. Only one spot was right. No pattern she could see. This was the hardest one yet.
