      Noah stands at the forest's edge looking out toward a rocky hillside. The compass needle
      points directly at a dark cave mouth that yawns between two massive boulders. The cave
      looks ominous—shadows deep and unwelcoming, cold mist seeping out. Noah's posture shows
      reluctance—leaning back, free hand gripping his shirt. But his eyes also show determination.
      The afternoon sun makes the cave's darkness seem even more forbidding by contrast.

      The compass pointed at the cave—dark, cold, exactly where Noah didn't want to go.
      "What you need to face," the fox had said. Noah's stomach twisted. He took one step forward.

      Noah enters the cave mouth, one hand on the rock wall, the other holding the compass which
      now glows with golden light, illuminating the darkness. The cave interior reveals crystal
      formations that catch and multiply the light—suddenly the scary cave becomes a cathedral of
      beauty. Noah's expression shifts from fear to wonder, mouth open in amazement. Strange,
      beautiful minerals glitter in the walls. The path descends deeper.

      Inside, the cave transformed. His compass lit up like a lantern, revealing walls of crystal
      that sang with light. Noah laughed despite his fear. "Oh. You were showing me this." Maybe
      scary paths hid the most beautiful destinations.
