      A chamber deep in the Library where blank canvases float in the air, waiting to be painted.
      Some glow with potential. Others seem to shimmer and fade. Maya walks cautiously through,
      trying to figure out which canvases to paint. A mirror-creature appears, its body made of
      shifting reflective surfaces. "These canvases are too demanding," it says smoothly. "I know
      the trick—paint faster! More! Cover the whole canvas quickly!" The creature gestures to
      canvases that look easy to fill. Maya's expression shows doubt—something feels wrong. The
      atmosphere is tense with uncertainty.

      Maya followed golden threads deeper into the Library. A chamber filled with floating canvases waiting to be painted. A mirror-creature appeared, all shifting surfaces. "These canvases are too demanding. I know the trick—paint faster! More! Cover everything!" It pointed to canvases that looked easy. Quick. Simple. Maya's heart pounded. Too simple felt wrong.

    focus: Encountering misleading help
    visual: |
      The mirror-creature paints frantically—quick strokes, bright colors, filling canvases at
      incredible speed. Images appear: birds, flowers, faces—beautiful but shallow. "See?" it says.
      But then the paintings FLICKER and dissolve like mist. They weren't given enough care to be
      real! The canvases go blank again. The creature itself dissolves into nothing—it was never
      truly there. Maya jumps back. The golden threads pulse brighter, pointing toward canvases that
      require patience and presence. Maya's expression shows shaken understanding. There are no
      shortcuts to creating life. She must do the slow work of painting with care. Text in Times New

      The creature painted frantically. Quick strokes, bright colors, done! Images appeared—birds, flowers, faces. "See? Simple!" But then they FLICKERED. Dissolved like mist. They weren't given enough to be real. The creature dissolved too. Maya's heart raced. The golden threads pointed at canvases that needed patience. No shortcuts. She had to paint with care.
