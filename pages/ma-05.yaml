      A chamber deep in the Library where word riddles float in the air, each one creating visual
      illusions. One riddle about "light" creates glowing orbs. One about "shadow" creates dark
      pools. Maya walks cautiously through, trying to distinguish which riddles are real challenges
      and which are distractions. A mirror-fox appears, its body made of shifting reflective surfaces.
      "These riddles are too complex," it says smoothly. "I know which ones matter. Follow me." The
      fox points to riddles that look simple and clear. Maya's expression shows doubt—something feels
      wrong. The atmosphere is tense with uncertainty. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space

      Maya followed golden threads deeper into the Library. A chamber filled with word riddles that created illusions. Light. Shadow. Truth. Lies. A mirror-fox appeared. "These riddles are too complex. I know the shortcuts." It pointed to riddles that looked simple. Clear. Easy. Maya's heart pounded. Too easy felt wrong.

    visual: |
      The mirror-fox confidently solves the "easy" riddles, reading only their surface meanings.
      Illusions flare around it—beautiful but false. "See?" it says. But then the illusions CRACK
      like broken glass. The easy riddles were traps! They shatter, taking the fox with them into
      darkness. Maya jumps back from the edge. The golden threads pulse brighter, pointing toward
      the complex riddles—the ones that require reading both surface and depth. Maya's expression
      shows shaken understanding. There are no shortcuts to seeing truly. She must do the hard work
      of looking deeper. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The fox solved the easy riddles, reading only surfaces. "See? Simple!" Illusions flared bright. Then CRACKED. The easy riddles were traps! They shattered like glass. The fox dropped into darkness. Maya's heart raced. The golden threads pointed at the complex riddles—the ones with layers. No shortcuts. She had to look deeper.
