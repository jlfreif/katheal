      A hall of mirrors where everything reflects endlessly. Maya walks through, seeing herself
      and the world reflected back. A smooth, confident creature made entirely of reflective
      surfaces glides toward her. Its voice is persuasive and certain. "Why bother looking deeper?
      Reflections show you everything. Judge by what you see in the mirror—it never lies." Around
      them, creatures look at their reflections and nod in agreement, trusting only the surface
      image. The atmosphere feels seductive but hollow.

      The golden thread led Maya to a hall of mirrors. Everything reflected back perfect and clear. A mirror creature smiled. "Why waste time looking deeper? Reflections show the truth. What you see is what you get." It sounded so easy. So certain.

      The mirror creature demonstrates, showing Maya her own reflection—confident, bold, strong.
      "See? This is all you need to know." But then Maya notices the reflection doesn't show her
      pink streak, doesn't show the paint under her nails, doesn't show the nervous habit of
      tapping her foot. The reflection is accurate but incomplete. When she reaches out to touch
      the mirror, it ripples and distorts, showing her as a completely different person. The
      mirror creature starts to fade, becoming transparent—it has no depth, only surface. Maya
      steps back, alarmed.

      Maya looked at her reflection. It looked right. But it didn't show her pink streak, her paint-stained fingers, her tapping foot. Only the surface. The mirror creature kept reflecting until it faded to nothing—all surface, no depth. It vanished with a confused shimmer. Reflections weren't enough. She needed to look inside.
