      A hall of mirrors where everything reflects endlessly. Maya walks cautiously through, seeing
      herself and the world reflected back. A creature made entirely of shifting reflective surfaces
      blocks her path—tall, imposing, constantly changing to show different reflections. "To pass,
      you must find the real me among my reflections," it challenges. Dozens of copies appear in
      the mirrors around Maya, all moving differently. Some look fierce, some look friendly, some
      look scared. The creature splits into multiple reflected versions, surrounding her. Maya's
      expression shows determination. The atmosphere is tense with challenge.

      The golden thread led Maya to a hall of mirrors. A creature made of reflections blocked her path. "Find the real me among the copies," it said. Dozens of versions appeared—fierce ones, friendly ones, scared ones. They moved fast, circling. Maya's heart pounded. This wasn't a quiz. This was a test.

      The mirror creatures dart and weave around Maya. She's in motion—dodging, observing, looking
      for details the reflections can't copy. Her artist's eye catches it: the real creature has a
      tiny crack in its surface that the reflections don't show, and its movements are slightly
      different—more hesitant, more careful. Maya lunges forward, hand extended, touching the one
      with the crack. All the reflections shatter like glass, dissolving into golden light. The
      real creature stands revealed—small, uncertain, grateful. It bows and steps aside. Maya grins,
      breathing hard. The path opens beyond.

      The copies darted around her. Fast. Confusing. Maya didn't panic. She watched. Really watched. There—the real one had a tiny crack the reflections couldn't copy. Its movements were different too. More careful. Maya lunged, touched the crack. The copies shattered into light. "Did NOT sign up for a mirror maze workout today," she said, catching her breath. But she'd done it. Seeing deeper meant seeing what reflections missed.
