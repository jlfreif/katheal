      A strange grove where colors shift and change constantly—trees that ripple from green to
      blue to purple, flowers that can't decide what shade to be, grass that matches whatever
      stands on it. Maya walks carefully through, watching everything change around her. Nothing
      stays itself. A large chameleon sits on a branch, its scales shifting through every color
      of the rainbow in perfect mimicry. Its eyes fix on Maya with knowing intelligence. The
      grove feels beautiful but unsettling—too much adaptation, not enough authenticity. Maya's
      expression shows fascination mixed with unease.

      Maya entered a grove where nothing stayed the same color for more than a heartbeat. Everything
      shifted, adapted, matched its surroundings. A chameleon watched from a branch, cycling through
      perfect color matches. "You're trying too hard," it said smoothly. "Watch me. I blend
      perfectly. No one ever objects to my colors. Let me show you how to make everyone happy."

      The chameleon demonstrates, its scales shifting to create a perfectly pleasant, perfectly
      average color—not grey but not vibrant either, carefully calculated to offend no one and
      delight no one. It gestures for Maya to try the same. Maya holds up her hand, starting to
      shift her paint colors toward matching, blending, being less bold. The golden threads around
      her dim dangerously. Her expression shows internal conflict—the appeal of being accepted
      versus staying true. Before she fully commits, the chameleon's own color fades completely
      to transparent—it's matched so much it disappeared. Maya jerks back in alarm. The atmosphere
      shifts from temptation to warning.

      The chameleon showed her its secret—perfect blending, careful matching, never standing out.
      "See? No one minds when you match them." Maya almost tried it, almost dulled her bold pink
      to something safer. But the chameleon kept matching and matching until it faded completely
      transparent, lost in trying to please everyone. It disappeared with a confused chirp. Maya
      stepped back, heart pounding. Being yourself might be scary. But disappearing was worse.
