      A strange grove where colors shift and change constantly—trees that ripple from green to
      blue to purple, flowers that can't decide what shade to be, grass that matches whatever
      stands on it. Maya walks carefully through, watching everything change around her. Nothing
      stays itself. A large chameleon sits on a branch, its scales shifting through every color
      of the rainbow in perfect mimicry. Its eyes fix on Maya with knowing intelligence. The
      grove feels beautiful but unsettling—too much adaptation, not enough authenticity. Maya's
      expression shows fascination mixed with unease.

      The golden thread led Maya deeper into Kathaél, to a grove where nothing stayed one color. Everything shifted, matched, blended. A chameleon watched from a branch. "I blend perfectly," it said smoothly. "Let me show you how to make everyone happy."

    visual: |
      The chameleon demonstrates, its scales shifting to create a perfectly pleasant, perfectly
      average color—not grey but not vibrant either, carefully calculated to offend no one and
      delight no one. It gestures for Maya to try the same. Maya holds up her hand, starting to
      shift her paint colors toward matching, blending, being less bold. The golden threads around
      her dim dangerously. Her expression shows internal conflict—the appeal of being accepted
      versus staying true. Before she fully commits, the chameleon's own color fades completely
      to transparent—it's matched so much it disappeared. Maya jerks back in alarm. The atmosphere
      shifts from temptation to warning.

      The chameleon showed her. Perfect matching, careful blending, never standing out. Maya almost tried it, almost made her pink safer. But the chameleon kept matching until it faded completely transparent. It disappeared with a confused chirp. Maya stepped back. Being yourself might be scary. But disappearing was worse.
