    visual: |
      Maya stands at the edge of an enormous amphitheater where hundreds of
      frozen performances fill the space—dancers mid-leap, singers with mouths
      open, artists with brushes raised. All stuck. All silent. The Heart
      Crystal pulses dimly in the distance. A nearby dancer crumbles to dust.
      Maya's eyes widen with alarm at the scale.

      The amphitheater stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen performances
      filled every stage, every platform, every corner. Dancers stuck mid-leap.
      Singers frozen on their notes. Artists captured mid-brushstroke. The
      Crystal pulsed dimmer in the distance. A nearby dancer crumbled to dust,
      her performance lost forever. "Oh no," Maya whispered. "This is really,
      really bad."

    focus: Encountering misleading help

    visual: |
      A dramatic performer in elaborate costume gestures sharply, demonstrating
      perfect rigid technique. Behind them, frozen dancers strain against
      invisible rules. The performer snaps at Maya to stand straighter, point
      her toes more, stop moving so wildly. Maya's natural flowing style
      clashes with the rigid demands. Her expression shows doubt and discomfort.

      "Posture!" A performer in elaborate costume snapped fingers at Maya.
      "Technique! Form! You must perform CORRECTLY!" They demonstrated perfect
      rigid movements, each gesture sharp and controlled. Maya tried to copy,
      but her body wanted to flow and bounce and add her own flair. The frozen
      dancers around them seemed to strain harder, as if the rules were choking
      them. "This feels wrong," Maya said quietly.
