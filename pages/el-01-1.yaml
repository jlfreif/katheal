      Elise sits cross-legged in a sunny window seat, sketchbook open on her lap, surrounded by
      art supplies—colored pencils, charcoal, small jars of paint. She's 9 years old, slim with
      graceful posture, completely absorbed in her drawing. Her fingers have smudges of charcoal.
      Around her, the walls display dozens of her nature sketches—flowers, insects, birds—all
      meticulously detailed. She's drawing a butterfly, tongue slightly out in concentration. The
      room is peaceful but there's a subtle loneliness to her solitary focus.

      Elise drew every tiny vein in the butterfly's wing, capturing what others rushed past.
      She noticed everything—but sometimes wondered if anyone noticed her.

      Elise looks up from her sketchbook as something extraordinary appears outside her window.
      A paperbird—made of folded parchment that seems alive—hovers just beyond the glass. Its
      wings shift colors like emotions: soft blue to pale gold to worried gray. Elise's eyes
      widen with wonder and concern. The paperbird seems to be looking directly at her, and
      something about its color-shifting seems desperate, like it's trying to communicate. Her
      hand reaches toward the window instinctively.

      A paperbird appeared at her window, wings flashing colors she'd never seen. But something
      was wrong—its edges were fading, colors flickering like a dying flame. It looked at her,
      and Elise felt it: "Help me."
