    focus: Recognizing what doesn't work

    visual: |
      A serene glade carpeted with soft emerald moss and dotted with small luminous
      mushrooms. Golden threads flow through the air like gentle streams of light,
      weaving between ancient trees. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair, slim and
      graceful) enters the clearing, looking tired from previous efforts. She spots
      little Mona (2 years old, dark curly hair, bright curious eyes) sitting cross-legged
      on the moss, perfectly still, just watching the threads dance. The light is soft
      and warm, creating a peaceful atmosphere.

      Elise had tried everything. Pulling threads, painting patterns, following the
      obvious paths. Nothing worked. She stepped into the quiet glade and stopped.
      A tiny girl sat in the moss, utterly still, watching golden threads flow past
      her face. The threads seemed... calmer here. Gentler.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern through stillness

    visual: |
      Elise sits beside Mona on the moss, both children now motionless and observing.
      The golden threads flow closer to them, almost curious, responding to their quiet
      presence. One thread hovers near Mona's outstretched palm, not pulled but drawn.
      Elise's expression shows dawning realization. The threads glow brighter around
      them, their movement more fluid and alive than when approached with force. Soft
      particles of light drift through the air like gentle snow.

      Elise sat beside her. Together they watched, silent. The threads drifted closer,
      curious about their stillness. "Soft," Mona whispered. "Gentle." Elise nodded slowly.
      The threads had been running from grabbing hands, from desperate attempts. But here,
      with just watching and waiting, they came willingly. "You're right," Elise breathed.
      "They want us to be present, not pushy."
