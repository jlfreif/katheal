      A peaceful grove where various instruments hang from tree branches like fruit: small drums,
      bells, flutes, and wind chimes. All are silent and still despite a gentle breeze. Elise
      stands in the center, reaching carefully toward a hanging harp, her movements precise and
      controlled as if afraid to disturb anything. A tiny figure toddles into the grove—Mona,
      her face lit with curiosity. She immediately runs to a set of wind chimes hanging low,
      grabbing them with both hands. The instruments are beautiful but lifeless, their golden
      threads dim and tangled. Afternoon light filters through the leaves, creating soft patterns
      on the ground.

      Elise reached for the hanging harp, fingers positioned perfectly for the right notes.
      She'd been trying so hard to play everything correctly, to perform flawlessly. But nothing
      woke up. Movement caught her eye. A toddler burst into the grove, squealing with delight.
      Before Elise could warn her to be careful, tiny hands grabbed the wind chimes and shook
      them wildly.

    visual: |
      Mona enthusiastically bangs on the wind chimes, her whole body bouncing with joy, creating
      chaotic but genuine sounds. Elise watches, her expression shifting from concern to wonder
      as the chimes begin to glow faintly. The golden threads connecting the chimes brighten and
      start to untangle. Elise drops her perfect posture and begins to hum a silly, made-up melody,
      swaying freely. Around them, other instruments shimmer in response. The grove fills with
      soft golden light. Mona giggles, still shaking the chimes. The atmosphere transforms from
      careful silence to joyful experimentation.

      The chimes rang out, messy and loud and completely imperfect. And they glowed. Their
      threads brightened, responding to Mona's pure joy. Elise caught her breath. What if they'd
      been doing it wrong? What if perfect wasn't the point? She dropped her careful posture
      and hummed something silly, made-up, completely herself. The harp shimmered. Around them,
      instruments began waking up.
