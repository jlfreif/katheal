      A grove where rhythm-paths wind between trees, each path lined with hanging musical chimes.
      Elise dances carefully on one path, hitting the footprints with precise technique—step,
      turn, pop-and-lock. The path flickers weakly beneath her feet but won't hold the light.
      The chimes above her stay silent. She's breathing hard, frustrated, moving perfectly but
      getting nowhere. A tiny figure toddles into the grove from another path—Mona (2 years old,
      Caucasian with fair skin, wavy short dark brown ringlets, curious and joyful), her face lit with wonder. She immediately starts bouncing on a nearby
      path, not following any pattern, just moving with pure joy. The chimes above her start to
      ring softly. Afternoon light filters through the leaves.

      Elise followed the rhythm-path into a grove lined with chimes where a tiny figure burst in. "Mona?" Mona bounced on another path, not following any pattern. Just joy. The chimes above Mona rang. Elise danced carefully. Perfect technique. Step, turn, pop-and-lock. The chimes stayed silent.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Elise watches Mona (2 years old, Caucasian with fair skin, wavy short dark brown ringlets, curious and joyful),bounce joyfully, then tries something new. She hits the same footprints
      as before—but this time adds a laugh, throws her arms wide with joy, adds a spontaneous
      spin that isn't in the pattern. The path blazes bright beneath her feet. The chimes ring
      loud and clear. Mona giggles and claps. "Dance! Dance!" Elise grins and keeps going, mixing
      technical moves with pure joy—a perfect pop-and-lock followed by a silly wiggle. The paths
      light up stronger than ever before. Golden threads brighten throughout the grove, connecting
      the paths and chimes. The grove fills with music and light. The pattern was clear: technique
      plus joy.

      Elise tried again. Same footprints. But this time she laughed. Threw her arms wide. Added a spin just for fun. The path blazed bright. The chimes rang loud. "Dance! Dance!" Mona clapped. Elise kept going—pop-and-lock plus a silly wiggle. Technical moves mixed with joy. The paths lit up stronger than ever. Golden threads connected everything. That was the pattern. Technique plus joy.
