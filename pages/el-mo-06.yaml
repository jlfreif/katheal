    focus: Recognizing what doesn't work

    visual: |
      A serene glade carpeted with soft emerald moss and dotted with small luminous
      mushrooms. Golden threads flow through the air like gentle streams of light,
      weaving between ancient trees. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair, slim and
      graceful) steps into the clearing, catching her breath from running. She spots
      little Mona (2 years old, dark curly hair, bright curious eyes) sitting cross-legged
      on the moss, perfectly still, just watching the threads dance. The light is soft
      and warm, creating a peaceful atmosphere.

      Elise had tried everything. Pulling threads, painting patterns, forcing her dance
      to be bigger. Nothing worked. She stepped into the quiet glade and stopped. A tiny
      girl sat in the moss, utterly still, watching golden threads flow past her face.
      The threads seemed... calmer here. Gentler.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern through gentle movement

    visual: |
      Mona sits cross-legged on the moss, perfectly still, watching. Beside her, Elise
      moves in slow, meditative dance—arms flowing like gentle water, turns measured
      and peaceful. The golden threads flow closer to both of them, drawn by their quiet
      presence. One thread hovers near Mona's palm while another weaves around Elise's
      gracefully extended hand. Elise's expression shows dawning realization. Soft
      particles of light drift through the air like gentle snow.

      Elise began to dance beside Mona, but this time differently. Slow. Meditative.
      Her arms flowed like gentle water, each turn measured and peaceful. The threads
      drifted closer, curious about their quiet presence. "Soft," Mona whispered.
      "Gentle." Elise nodded, continuing her flowing dance. The threads had been running
      from force. But here, with gentle movement and patient presence, they came willingly.
      "You're right," Elise breathed. "Gentle can be strong."
