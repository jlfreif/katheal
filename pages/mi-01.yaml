      Micah's room arranged like an obstacle course—chair backs for vaulting, pillows as landing
      pads, bed frame for climbing. Micah (9 years old, black hair, athletic build, half-Japanese
      half-Caucasian, wearing grey t-shirt and black shorts) mid-jump between furniture pieces,
      body in dynamic motion, face showing intense focus and joy. His trombone case leans in
      corner. Japanese study materials on desk. The room is organized chaos, everything positioned
      for movement. His expression shows high energy and delight in physical activity. The
      atmosphere is kinetic and energetic—a kid in his element.

      Micah vaulted over the chair back, landed on the pillow, bounced to his feet, climbed the bedpost. Moving felt good. His body hummed with energy. He flipped off the bed, stuck the landing. "And that's how it's done!" he announced in Japanese, grinning. His room was an obstacle course. His life was constant motion. Perfect.

      A streak of golden light shoots through Micah's window, zipping between his obstacles
      faster than he's ever moved. It loops around him three times, then hovers in the air.
      Words form in glowing letters: "Fast isn't always fastest." The light is made of pure
      golden energy, shimmering and alive. Then it streaks through the wall, leaving a portal
      of light. Micah's expression shows curiosity and competitive interest—a puzzle to solve.
      The atmosphere crackles with challenge and mystery.

      Suddenly, a streak of golden light shot through his window, zipping between his obstacles faster than Micah had ever moved. It looped around him three times, then hovered. Words formed in the air: "Fast isn't always fastest." Micah tilted his head. The light streaked through his wall into another world. But the challenge in those words pulled at him. Micah dove after it.
