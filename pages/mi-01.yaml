      Micah launches himself over a wooden obstacle in his backyard, black hair
      flying, body mid-leap in a perfectly balanced parkour vault. His athletic
      half-Japanese build shows coordination and power. He's grinning with pure
      joy, completely in his element. The yard shows evidence of constant practice:
      makeshift obstacles, a rope swing, balance beams. His trombone case leans
      against the back porch.

      Micah sprinted across the yard and vaulted over the wooden rail in one smooth
      motion. Land, roll, up again—his body knew the rhythm without thinking. This
      was how he felt most alive: moving, jumping, never staying still. "Faster,"
      he whispered to himself, already planning the next run. He backed up for
      another attempt, bouncing on his toes.

    visual: |
      Micah stands frozen mid-bounce, looking up at the sky with wide eyes. Golden
      threads crisscross overhead like a net, but several are flickering wildly,
      losing their glow. One thread breaks loose and begins to fall like a dying
      firefly, drifting down toward him. His hands reach up instinctively to catch
      it. The light reflects in his dark eyes, showing wonder mixed with concern.

      Something caught his eye mid-bounce. Golden threads overhead—he'd never
      noticed them before—flickered like bad light bulbs. One snapped free and
      tumbled through the air, dimming as it fell. Micah's hands shot up on instinct
      and caught it. The thread pulsed weakly in his palms, warm and urgent, like
      a heartbeat racing too fast. "Whoa," he breathed. "What's happening to you?"
