      Micah's room with climbable furniture—bookshelf, desk, bed frame. Micah (9 years old,
      black hair, athletic build, half-Japanese half-Caucasian, wearing grey t-shirt and black
      shorts) climbs carefully from chair to desk to bookshelf, never getting more than five feet
      off the ground. His movements are confident but cautious—he knows his limits. His trombone
      case leans in corner. Japanese study materials on desk. The room is arranged for safe
      climbing. His expression shows focused enjoyment within boundaries. The atmosphere is
      comfortable and controlled—fun without fear.

      Micah climbed from his desk to his bookshelf, always staying close to the ground. Five feet was high enough. Higher than that felt scary—too much empty space below. He liked climbing. Just not too high.

    visual: |
      Through Micah's window, a massive golden tower appears in the sky, rising higher than any
      building he's ever seen. It stretches up and up and up, disappearing into clouds. Golden
      threads weave from the tower toward his window, inviting him in. Micah stares up at it,
      frozen. It's so high. So impossibly, terrifyingly high. But it's also beautiful, calling
      to him. A golden feather drifts through his window and lands on his desk, glowing. His
      expression shows fascination mixed with deep fear. The atmosphere crackles with impossible
      heights and the challenge of facing them.

      Through his window, a tower of golden light rose into the sky. Higher than anything Micah had ever seen. Higher than buildings. Higher than clouds. So high it made his stomach drop just looking at it. A golden feather drifted through his window. The tower was calling. But it was so high. Micah swallowed hard. Too high.
