      Micah (9 years old, black hair, athletic half-Japanese build, medium height) vaults over
      a park bench mid-run, arms extended for balance. His body is captured in dynamic motion,
      one foot touching the bench, the other in the air. Behind him, a trail of scattered
      belongings marks his path: a dropped jacket, an abandoned skateboard, a forgotten water
      bottle. Other kids play in the background but Micah moves faster than all of them. His
      expression shows pure energy and restlessness. The park is full of afternoon sunlight.

      Micah couldn't stay still. Ever. He ran when other kids walked. He climbed when they
      sat. His body needed to move, move, move, or it felt like he'd explode. In the park,
      he vaulted benches and raced invisible opponents. Stopping felt impossible. Stopping
      felt wrong. He was always chasing the next thing.

    focus: First hint of something different

    visual: |
      Micah has stopped mid-run to tie his shoe, kneeling on one knee. In this rare moment
      of stillness, a shimmering portal of golden light appears before him, hovering between
      two trees. His face shows surprise as he looks up from his laces, mouth open in an
      astonished "whoa." Golden threads drift out from the portal, moving gently in contrast
      to his usual frantic energy. One thread floats close to his face. The portal pulses
      softly, waiting. He's frozen in this unusual pause.

      But then his shoelace came untied and he had to stop. Just for a second. That's when
      he saw it: a doorway made of light, shimmering between the trees. It hadn't been there
      before. His hand paused on his lace. The light pulsed gently, like it was breathing.
      Without thinking, Micah reached toward it. The moment his fingers touched the glow, everything shifted.
