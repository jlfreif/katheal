      Micah's room arranged like an obstacle course—chair backs for vaulting, pillows as landing
      pads, bed frame for climbing. Micah (9 years old, black hair, athletic build, half-Japanese
      half-Caucasian, wearing grey t-shirt and black shorts) mid-jump between furniture pieces,
      body in dynamic motion, face showing intense focus and joy. His trombone case leans in
      corner. Japanese study materials on desk. The room is organized chaos, everything positioned
      for movement. His expression shows high energy and constant activity. The atmosphere is
      kinetic and restless—always moving, never still.

      Micah vaulted over the chair back, landed on the pillow, bounced to his feet, and climbed
      the bedpost in one continuous flow. Moving felt good. Stopping felt impossible. His body
      needed to go-go-go, jumping and climbing and never holding still. Stillness made him itchy
      and restless. Motion was life. He spun and prepared for another vault.

      A streak of golden light moves through Micah's room, faster than he's ever moved, zipping
      between furniture, over his head, around his legs. Micah freezes mid-jump—shocked into
      stillness by something faster than he is. The light forms a playful creature, part bird
      part wind, made of pure golden energy and motion. It swirls around him then pauses in the
      air, waiting. Words form in its wake: "Catch me if you can." Micah's expression shows
      competitive delight mixed with surprise. The atmosphere crackles with challenge and
      impossible speed.

      A streak of golden light shot through his room, faster than Micah had ever moved. It zipped
      and dove and spiraled, too quick to catch or even follow. Micah froze, stunned. Something
      was faster than him? Impossible. The light formed words in the air: "Catch me if you can."
      Then it darted toward the window, beckoning. Micah grinned, competitive fire lighting his
      eyes. Challenge accepted.
