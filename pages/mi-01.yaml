      Micah's room arranged like an obstacle course—chair backs for vaulting, pillows as landing
      pads, bed frame for climbing. Micah (9 years old, black hair, athletic build, half-Japanese
      half-Caucasian, wearing grey t-shirt and black shorts) mid-jump between furniture pieces,
      body in dynamic motion, face showing intense focus and joy. His trombone case leans in
      corner. Japanese study materials on desk. The room is organized chaos, everything positioned
      for movement. His expression shows high energy and constant activity. The atmosphere is
      kinetic and restless—always moving, never still.

      Micah vaulted over the chair back, landed on the pillow, bounced to his feet, climbed the bedpost. Moving felt good. Stopping felt impossible. His body needed to go-go-go.

      A streak of golden light moves through Micah's room, faster than he's ever moved, zipping
      between furniture, over his head, around his legs. Micah freezes mid-jump—shocked into
      stillness by something faster than he is. The light forms a playful creature, part bird
      part wind, made of pure golden energy and motion. It swirls around him then pauses in the
      air, waiting. Words form in its wake: "Catch me if you can." Micah's expression shows
      competitive delight mixed with surprise. The atmosphere crackles with challenge and
      impossible speed.

      A streak of golden light shot through his room, faster than Micah had ever moved. It zipped and dove and spiraled. Micah froze, stunned. Something was faster than him? The light formed words. "Catch me if you can." Challenge accepted.
