description: Elise sits alone drawing in her quiet corner, feeling unseen, when a fading paperbird appears at her window asking for help—and she follows it into the Whispering Woods.

visual: |
  Elise stands at the edge of the Whispering Woods where afternoon light creates a golden
  archway between trees. She's dressed simply, carrying her sketchbook clutched to her chest
  like a shield and a comfort. The paperbird waits at the forest's edge, wings still flickering
  worryingly between colors. Elise feels anxious—the woods are big and she's small—but the
  paperbird needs her. She takes a breath, gathering quiet courage, and steps forward. The
  woods seem to welcome her with gentle rustling.

  Elise drew every tiny vein in the butterfly's wing, capturing what others rushed past. She
  noticed everything—but sometimes wondered if anyone noticed her. A paperbird appeared at her
  window, wings flashing colors she'd never seen—but something was wrong, its edges fading like
  a dying flame. It looked at her, and Elise felt it: "Help me." "I see you," Elise whispered,
  and the paperbird seemed to understand. It flew toward the woods, then stopped, looking back.
  Elise's heart beat fast as she entered the woods. She was scared, but the paperbird needed
  someone who truly saw it. Maybe that's why it chose her.
