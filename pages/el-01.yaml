      Elise's bedroom with a large mirror against one wall, afternoon sunlight streaming through
      the window creating patterns on the wooden floor. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair in
      a ponytail, slim build, wearing black leggings and her provence t-shirt) stands before
      the mirror practicing a dance routine. Her arms extend gracefully, one leg raised, body
      moving fluidly through the choreography. Stuffed animals sit on her bed watching. Dance
      posters cover the walls. Her expression shows focus and joy, completely absorbed in the
      movement. She hums a melody that matches her steps. The room feels safe and familiar.

      Elise spun across her bedroom floor, arms flowing like water, humming a melody only she
      could hear. The mirror showed her reflection moving through the routine—extend, turn, leap,
      land. Dancing was how she thought, how she felt, how she made sense of everything. Each
      movement told a story only her body knew how to speak.

    visual: |
      Elise mid-spin when she notices something in the mirror that isn't her reflection. Behind
      her reflected image, a shimmer of golden light ripples across the glass like water. She
      freezes in position, one arm still extended, staring at the mirror with wide eyes. The
      golden shimmer forms threads that seem to move in time with her humming, pulsing gently.
      Her room looks normal, but in the mirror, the golden threads weave through her reflection,
      creating patterns in the air. Her expression shifts from focus to wonder. The atmosphere
      crackles with possibility.

      She froze mid-turn. In the mirror, golden threads appeared where none should be, weaving
      through the air behind her reflection. They pulsed in rhythm with her humming, dancing
      to the same melody. Elise turned to look behind her. Nothing. But when she faced the
      mirror again, the threads danced on, beckoning her to follow them somewhere her ordinary
      room couldn't contain.
