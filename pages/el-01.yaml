      Elise dances in front of a full-length mirror in her room, arms flowing gracefully
      through the air in a lyrical movement. Her long brown hair moves with her turns.
      She's humming to herself, creating choreography, completely absorbed. Drawings
      cover the wall behind her—forests, flowers, magical places. Her art supplies
      scatter across a desk by the window.

      Elise spun slowly in front of her mirror, arms flowing like water. She was creating
      a dance about a forest path she'd drawn earlier—each movement telling the story her
      pictures couldn't quite capture. Her feet traced patterns on the floor. She hummed
      a melody that matched her turns. This was how she thought best: through movement,
      through dance.

    focus: First hint of something different

    visual: |
      Elise has stopped mid-movement, one arm still extended, turning to look at the
      wall behind her. One of her drawings—a small flower—glows with soft golden light
      that doesn't match the lamp. The flower pulses gently, as if breathing in rhythm
      with her. Her eyes widen with curiosity. Her body naturally begins to sway toward
      it, drawn by the light.

      She spun toward the wall and froze mid-movement. The flower in her drawing was
      glowing. Elise blinked, but the light didn't disappear. It pulsed softly, like
      a tiny heartbeat, warm and golden in a way that had nothing to do with her lamp.
      Her body swayed toward it instinctively, pulled by curiosity. She stepped closer,
      watching the impossible light breathe.
