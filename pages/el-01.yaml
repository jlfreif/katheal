      Elise's bedroom with a large mirror against one wall, afternoon sunlight streaming through
      the window creating patterns on the wooden floor. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair in
      a ponytail, slim build, wearing black leggings and light pink t-shirt, white sneakers)
      stands before the mirror practicing a hip-hop routine. Her body pops and locks with sharp
      precision, feet hitting the floor in staccato rhythms. She spins, drops into a crouch, then
      springs up with arms extended. Stuffed animals sit on her bed watching. Dance posters cover
      the walls. Her expression shows focus and joy, completely absorbed in the movement. The
      wooden floor vibrates slightly under her steps. The room feels safe and familiar. Text in

      Elise's feet hit the floor. Boom, boom, tap. Her body moved sharp then smooth, popping and locking through the routine. The mirror showed her reflection dancing. Perfect form. Perfect rhythm. She spun, dropped low, sprang up. The afternoon belonged to her and the beat in her bones.

      Golden threads suddenly swirl through Elise's room, weaving through the air to create glowing
      musical notes that hang suspended. Quarter notes. Eighth notes. Whole notes. They pulse and
      chime with different tones, creating a melody. The threads spell out words in the air: "THE
      LIBRARY OF KATHAÉL NEEDS RHYTHM." A doorway forms, shimmering with golden light and
      musical harmonies. Through it, Elise glimpses ancient trees with books on branches and floating
      scrolls that chime like wind chimes. Her expression shows excitement mixed with wonder. This is
      music she can move to, a challenge she can dance. The atmosphere crackles with invitation. Text
