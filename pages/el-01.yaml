      Elise sits at a small desk by her window, hunched forward over a drawing. Her
      right hand holds a golden-yellow colored pencil hovering above the paper. Several
      pencils scatter across the desk near an open box of art supplies. Her expression
      is peaceful and absorbed in creative flow. Drawings cover the wall behind her.

      Elise drew a forest with a winding path and flowers that looked like they held
      secrets. She loved imagining quiet places where magic might hide. Her colored
      pencils moved slowly, carefully, the way she did everything. Outside her window,
      the afternoon light was ordinary, but on her page, she was making something that
      felt alive.

    visual: |
      Elise's head tilts slightly, eyes widening with curiosity. On her paper, one
      small flower she just finished glows with soft golden light that doesn't match
      the lamp. The flower pulses gently, as if breathing. Her pencil hovers frozen
      above the page. Afternoon light streams through the window behind her.

      The flower on her paper started to glow. Elise blinked, but the light didn't
      disappear. It pulsed softly, like a tiny heartbeat, warm and golden in a way
      that had nothing to do with her lamp. Her pencil hung still in the air. She
      leaned closer, watching the impossible light breathe.
