      Elise's bedroom with a large mirror against one wall, afternoon sunlight streaming through
      the window creating patterns on the wooden floor. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair in
      a ponytail, slim build, wearing black leggings and light pink t-shirt) stands before
      the mirror practicing a dance routine. Her arms snap sharply, hitting each position with
      attitude as she pops and locks through the choreography. Stuffed animals sit on her bed watching. Dance
      posters cover the walls. Her expression shows focus and joy, completely absorbed in the
      movement. She hums a melody that matches her steps. The room feels safe and familiar.

      Elise danced and the world made sense. Her feet knew the steps. Her arms knew the way. She hummed and moved and the afternoon belonged to her.

      Elise mid-spin when she notices something in the mirror that isn't her reflection. Behind
      her reflected image, a shimmer of golden light ripples across the glass like water. She
      freezes in position, one arm still extended, staring at the mirror with wide eyes. The
      golden shimmer forms threads that pulse and weave, beckoning her forward. Her room looks
      normal, but in the mirror, a forest path opens behind her reflection. She reaches toward
      the glass, her fingertips touching the cool surface. The mirror ripples. The atmosphere
      crackles with possibility.

      Then the mirror shimmered gold. Threads pulsed behind her reflection, weaving a forest path she'd never seen before. Elise touched the glass. It rippled like water. The threads danced brighter, beckoning. She stepped through.
