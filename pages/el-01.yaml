      Elise's bedroom with a large mirror against one wall, afternoon sunlight streaming through
      the window creating patterns on the wooden floor. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair in
      a ponytail, slim build, wearing black leggings and her provence t-shirt) stands before
      the mirror practicing a dance routine. Her arms extend gracefully, one leg raised, body
      moving fluidly through the choreography. Stuffed animals sit on her bed watching. Dance
      posters cover the walls. Her expression shows focus and joy, completely absorbed in the
      movement. She hums a melody that matches her steps. The room feels safe and familiar.

      Elise danced and the world made sense. Her feet knew the steps. Her arms knew the way. She hummed and spun and the afternoon belonged to her. This was how she thought, how she felt, how she made the day her own.

      Elise mid-spin when she notices something in the mirror that isn't her reflection. Behind
      her reflected image, a shimmer of golden light ripples across the glass like water. She
      freezes in position, one arm still extended, staring at the mirror with wide eyes. The
      golden shimmer forms threads that seem to move in time with her humming, pulsing gently.
      Her room looks normal, but in the mirror, the golden threads weave through her reflection,
      creating patterns in the air. Her expression shifts from focus to wonder. The atmosphere
      crackles with possibility.

      Then she saw them in the mirror. Golden threads that shouldn't be there. They danced with her humming, pulsed with her heartbeat. She turned around to look. Nothing. But in the mirror, the threads danced on, beckoning her to follow them somewhere her room couldn't contain.
