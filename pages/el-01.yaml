      Elise's bedroom with a large mirror against one wall, afternoon sunlight streaming through
      the window creating patterns on the wooden floor. Elise (9 years old, long brown hair in
      a ponytail, slim build, wearing black leggings and light pink t-shirt, white sneakers)
      stands before the mirror practicing a hip-hop routine. Her body pops and locks with sharp
      precision, feet hitting the floor in staccato rhythms. She spins, drops into a crouch, then
      springs up with arms extended. Stuffed animals sit on her bed watching. Dance posters cover
      the walls. Her expression shows focus and joy, completely absorbed in the movement. The
      wooden floor vibrates slightly under her steps. The room feels safe and familiar.

      Elise's feet hit the floor—boom, boom, tap. Her body moved sharp then smooth, popping and locking through the routine. The afternoon belonged to her and the rhythm in her bones.

      Elise mid-spin when she notices something in the mirror that isn't her reflection. Behind
      her reflected image, golden light ripples across the glass like water. She freezes in
      position, one arm still extended, staring at the mirror with wide eyes. The golden shimmer
      forms threads that pulse and weave. But through them, she can see a forest where glowing
      pathways lie broken and dark—paths that look like they need movement, need rhythm, need
      someone to dance them back to life. Her room looks normal, but in the mirror, the broken
      rhythm-paths call to her. She reaches toward the glass, fingertips touching the cool surface.
      The mirror ripples. The atmosphere crackles with possibility and challenge.

      Then the mirror shimmered gold. Through the threads, Elise saw a forest where glowing paths lay broken and dark. Paths that looked like they needed rhythm. Needed someone to move. She touched the glass. It rippled like water. The broken paths pulsed, calling. Elise stepped through.
