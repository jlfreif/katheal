      The Heart Crystal blazes with light, every facet glowing strong. Max's
      challenge weaves into the crystal structure, its imperfect form creating
      new patterns. Between his hands materializes a simple wristband woven
      from golden thread, glowing softly. The fox from earlier watches with
      approval, tail swishing.

      The Crystal blazed like a star, every facet strong again. Max's imperfect
      challenge wove itself into the pattern, and somehow its rough edges made
      the whole structure more resilient. Light gathered in his palms, warm
      and solid, until a wristband appeared—simple, golden, pulsing gently.
      The fox sat nearby, watching. Max grinned. "I really didn't quit."

    visual: |
      Max walks along a glowing path toward home, the wristband warm on his
      wrist. Around him, challenge courses complete themselves, incorporating
      mistakes into their designs instead of erasing them. A rabbit hops
      alongside him. His driveway with the basketball hoop glows warmly in
      the distance between trees.

      Max walked home, the wristband humming against his wrist. All around,
      frozen challenges began moving again, their designs incorporating the
      stumbles and adjustments that made them real. A rabbit hopped beside
      him for a few steps, then darted away. "Thank you," Max called to the
      forest. The basketball hoop in his driveway gleamed ahead, looking
      somehow different.
