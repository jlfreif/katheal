      The clearing of mechanisms transformed—every clockwork creature moving freely, bridges
      connecting, water wheels turning, all powered by golden threads. The clockwork deer leaps
      gracefully beside Max, fully alive. Max stands with hands cupped, receiving a gift from
      the mechanisms themselves: a small crystal gear that glows with golden light, pulsing with
      the rhythm of experimentation rather than perfection. Around him, mechanical creatures dance
      and play, celebrating. His expression shows joy and humble pride. A doorway opens in the
      clearing, leading home. The atmosphere celebrates success earned through persistence.

      Every mechanism moved, alive and joyful. The deer bounded around Max, its movements graceful
      but imperfect, magical because it was real. The mechanical owl descended, dropping a crystal
      gear into Max's hands—warm and pulsing. He understood. This was Kathaél's gift: the gear
      that valued trying over perfection, that turned failures into lessons. All his experiments
      had mattered. The doorway home shimmered, and he was ready.

    visual: |
      Max walks through the forest toward home, the crystal gear in his pocket glowing softly.
      He tosses a small pebble playfully, watching it spark with golden light mid-air—Kathaél's
      magic responding to his playful experimentation. He grins widely, mind already racing with
      ideas for new inventions to try. The clockwork deer trots beside him for a few steps before
      bounding back into the forest. Golden threads shimmer faintly in the air. His whole demeanor
      radiates confident curiosity. The atmosphere celebrates both completion and new beginnings.

      Max walked home with the crystal gear and a transformed perspective. Inventions needed tries,
      not immediate triumph. Failed experiments weren't wasted—they were research, each attempt
      revealing what worked and what didn't. The gear glowed warm in his pocket, reminding him
      that curiosity mattered more than certainty. He couldn't wait to get back to his workshop,
      to try new things without fear of failure.
