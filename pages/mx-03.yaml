      Max surrounded by floating blueprints and calculations that glow golden in the air. He
      works methodically on the clockwork deer, adjusting gears with precision tools, checking
      measurements against his math. Everything is perfectly calculated. He tightens the final
      spring, double-checks his work, then winds the key in the deer's side. The mechanisms click
      into place perfectly. Other broken machines lean in, watching. His expression shows confident
      certainty. The atmosphere is tense with anticipation—this should work.

      Max calculated every gear ratio, measured every spring tension, adjusted each mechanism to
      mathematical perfection. He'd analyzed the problem, found the solution, executed it flawlessly.
      The deer's gears aligned perfectly. He turned the key, watching his perfect repairs come
      to life. The mechanisms began to move exactly as designed. This was going to work.

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work
    visual: |
      The clockwork deer moves stiffly, mechanically, without grace or life. It takes two steps
      then freezes completely, more locked up than before. Max lunges forward to catch it as it
      topples, his face showing shock and dismay. The golden thread connected to it frays and
      dims. Around him, other mechanisms seem to retreat, losing hope. His perfect calculations
      scattered in the air flicker and fade. A mechanical owl appears on a nearby branch, its
      brass eyes whirring as it focuses on him. The atmosphere feels like deflating hope.

      The deer moved three stiff steps and froze solid, worse than before. Max caught it as it
      fell, staring in disbelief. His math was perfect. His execution flawless. But the deer felt
      more dead than ever, locked up by too much precision. A mechanical owl clicked and whirred
      above him. "Perfect calculations make perfect mechanisms," it said. "But Kathaél needs
      magic, not math. You must learn to play."
