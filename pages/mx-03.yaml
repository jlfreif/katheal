    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Max runs through an obstacle course with intense focus, his form perfect
      and controlled. He leaps barriers, balances on beams, climbs walls with
      textbook technique. Behind him, the obstacles he completes turn grey
      instead of glowing. His expression shows concentration and effort. He
      hasn't noticed the problem yet.

      Max attacked the first course with everything he had. Perfect form, no mistakes, complete the challenge exactly right. He vaulted the first obstacle cleanly, balanced across the second without wavering. Behind him, the obstacles he'd completed turned grey and cold. He landed the final jump. "Done!"

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work

    visual: |
      Max stands breathing hard, looking back at the course he completed. Every
      obstacle he touched has turned grey and lifeless. The golden threads
      connected to them have gone dark. A rabbit watches with sympathetic eyes.
      Max's confident expression crumbles to confusion and frustration.

      Max turned back, grinning, ready for his next challenge. The grin died. Every obstacle he'd completed perfectly was now grey as stone, threads dark and dead. "No. I did it right!" He ran back, tried again, faster this time, more perfect. More obstacles turned grey. The rabbit twitched its nose. "How can doing it right be wrong?"
