    visual: |
      Max runs the obstacle course like a basketball drill. He sprints to the rope swing with athletic
      confidence. Jump. Grab. Swing across. He lands clean, rolls, comes up running. The balance beam
      wobbles but he's steady—he's done worse in gym class. He keeps his weight centered, arms out.
      Around him, golden threads flicker faintly in response to his progress. Three obstacles down.
      The fox watches from a nearby branch. Max is grinning, clearly enjoying this physical challenge.
      The atmosphere is active, energetic, confident. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at

    visual: |
      Max hits a climbing section where the handholds suddenly shift and rotate as he touches them. He
      reaches for one and it spins backward. He grabs for another and it rotates away. Max loses his
      grip and falls, landing hard on his shoulder on the mat below. The entire course flickers and goes
      dark. Everything he'd just completed resets to broken, threads going lifeless. Max stands, rubbing
      his shoulder, looking up at the shifting handholds with surprise and frustration—not at himself,
      but at the difficulty of the challenge. "What?" The fox watches calmly. The atmosphere shifts from
      confident to challenged. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Then he hit the wall. Literally. A climbing section that shifted as he touched it, handholds rotating away. He grabbed for one and it spun backward. He fell, landed hard on his shoulder. The entire course flickered and went dark. Everything he'd completed reset to broken. "What?" Max stood, rubbing his shoulder. "I was doing it right! This is some next-level difficulty setting."
