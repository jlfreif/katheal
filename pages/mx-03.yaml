    focus: Trying the obvious solution
    visual: |
      Max is mid-action on an obstacle course - swinging on a rope, or balancing on a beam, or
      rolling from a landing. He moves with athletic grace and confidence, treating it like a
      basketball drill or gym class. His form is good, his movements precise. Around him, the
      golden threads flicker faintly in response to his progress. Three obstacles are behind him,
      partially restored. The fox watches from nearby. Max is grinning, clearly enjoying this.
      The atmosphere is active, energetic, confident. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white

      Max approached the first course like a basketball drill. Sprint to the rope swing. Jump. Grab. Swing across. He landed clean, rolled, came up running. The balance beam wobbled, but he'd done worse in gym class. Three obstacles down. "Easy," he muttered, grinning.

    visual: |
      Max has fallen to the ground, landing hard on his shoulder, rubbing it. Above him, a
      climbing wall shifts and rotates, handholds spinning away impossibly. The obstacles he'd
      just completed have gone dark and reset to broken. The golden threads are dim again. Max
      sits on the ground looking up at the course with surprise and frustration - not at himself,
      but at the difficulty of the challenge. The fox watches calmly. The atmosphere shifts from
      confident to challenged. Text in Times New Roman 16pt font in white space at bottom.

      Then he hit the wall. Literally. A climbing section that shifted as he touched it, handholds rotating away. He fell, landed hard on his shoulder. The entire course reset to broken. "What?" Max stood, rubbing his shoulder. "I was doing it right!" This was going to be harder than he thought.
