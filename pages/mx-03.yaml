      Max works on solving number sequences in the Library. Patterns float in the air around him—
      Fibonacci numbers, geometric progressions, prime sequences. He moves with confidence, filling
      in missing numbers with his analytical mind. His form is precise, his calculations accurate.
      Around him, golden threads flicker faintly in response to his progress. Three sequences glow
      completed behind him. The fox watches from a nearby branch. Max is grinning, clearly enjoying
      this puzzle. The atmosphere is active, energetic, confident. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in

      Max approached the first sequence like a math problem. The pattern was clear: 2, 4, 8, 16... Powers of two. He filled in the missing numbers. The sequence glowed. Next: Fibonacci. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... He solved it. Three sequences down. "Easy," he muttered, grinning.

      Max reaches a sequence that suddenly shifts and changes. The numbers he just filled in rearrange
      themselves. New variables appear. The pattern becomes three-dimensional, spiraling in impossible
      ways. Max steps back, eyes wide, trying to track the changes. The sequences he'd just completed
      have gone dark and reset to broken. The golden threads are dim again. Max stands looking up at
      the shifting patterns with surprise and frustration—not at himself, but at the difficulty of
      the challenge. The fox watches calmly. The atmosphere shifts from confident to challenged. Text

      Then he hit a sequence that changed. The numbers rearranged themselves. New variables appeared. The pattern spiraled in three dimensions. "What?" Max stared. "I solved it right!" The completed sequences reset to broken. His solutions had been correct. But that wasn't enough. This was going to be harder than he thought.
