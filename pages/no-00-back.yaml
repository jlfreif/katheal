visual: |
  Back cover design with soft watercolor background in mist blues and warm creams. Golden
  threads create an elegant border around the edges, weaving into subtle puzzle patterns
  and constellation symbols. A small facet of the Heart Crystal glows softly in the upper
  corner, casting prismatic light. The golden threads form decorative frames for the text
  areas. At the bottom, tiny silhouettes of six children (representing all the characters)
  stand together, connected by shimmering golden threads. The overall atmosphere is warm,
  enchanted, and inviting, with delicate ink linework adding detail to the magical elements.
  Space in the center is left clear for text placement.

synopsis: |
  When golden threads spell out "THE LIBRARY OF KATHAÉL NEEDS SOLVERS," puzzle-loving Noah
  can't resist the challenge. But in this enchanted realm, the Heart Crystal is cracking
  and stories are fading. To save them, Noah must learn that courage isn't about solving
  everything perfectly—it's about trying again when things go wrong.
