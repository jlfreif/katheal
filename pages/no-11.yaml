      The Heart-Loom glows brightly, fully healed, with Noah's completed thread
      woven through it. Words shimmer in the pattern. Noah holds both hands at
      chest height, and between them hovers a single blank page glowing with
      soft golden light. The fox from earlier watches from the edge, approving.

      Noah's story wove itself into the tapestry, finding an ending he never would
      have imagined. The Heart-Loom blazed with light, fully healed. The fox from
      the forest sat nearby, eyes bright. Then warmth gathered in Noah's palms: a
      blank page, glowing with possibility. "A beginning," he breathed. "Not
      an ending."

    visual: |
      Noah walks along a glowing path, the blank page tucked against his chest.
      Around him, frozen story-threads complete themselves one by one, words
      blooming like flowers. The forest feels alive. His ordinary world glows
      warmly in the distance.

      All around him, stories finished themselves. Threads that had hung frozen
      finally found their endings. The rabbit with ancient eyes hopped past,
      and Noah laughed. "Thank you," he called to the forest. He hoped the girl
      at the crossroads could feel this too. The blank page warmed against his
      heart as he walked home.
