      The Heart-Loom's threads now weave together in a beautiful, coherent pattern,
      spiraling and intersecting in an organic design. Noah's own thread glows
      brightly, integrated into the tapestry. He holds both hands at chest height,
      and between them hovers a golden quill made of pure light. His expression
      shows quiet wonder and accomplishment.

      The tapestry accepted his truth. Noah watched his thread weave itself into
      the pattern, connecting to dozens of other threads, making the whole design
      stronger. Something warm settled in his chest. Then light gathered between
      his palms, forming a quill of pure gold. A gift. A thank you.

    visual: |
      Noah walks along a glowing path leading away from the nexus, the golden
      quill tucked carefully in his shirt pocket. The forest around him is clear
      and beautiful, no longer obscured by fog. Golden particles drift through
      the air like gentle snow. In the distance, his ordinary world waits, visible
      as a warm glow between the trees.

      Noah tucked the quill into his pocket, where it pulsed warmly against his
      heart. The path home glowed beneath his feet, clear and inviting. Kathaél
      looked different now that he wasn't frantically searching for answers. It
      looked peaceful. Beautiful. And somehow, even as he walked away, he knew
      he'd always be connected to it.
