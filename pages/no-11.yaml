      The Heart-Loom glows with Noah's completed thread woven through it. The
      thread has written its own ending, words shimmering in the pattern. Noah
      holds both hands at chest height, and between them hovers a single blank
      page that glows with soft golden light—empty but full of possibility.

      His story wove itself into the tapestry, finding its own ending—one he never
      would have written, but perfect somehow. Noah watched the words settle into
      place. Then warmth gathered in his palms: a blank page, glowing with possibility.
      Not an ending. A beginning. The greatest gift.

    visual: |
      Noah walks along a glowing path, the blank page tucked carefully against his
      chest. Around him, frozen story-threads are beginning to write themselves,
      completing one by one. The forest feels alive with endings finally allowed
      to happen. His ordinary world glows warmly in the distance.

    text: |
      All around him, stories were finishing themselves. Threads that had hung
      frozen for who-knows-how-long finally found their endings, words blooming
      like flowers. Noah walked home through a forest of completing tales, the
      blank page warm against his heart. He understood now.
