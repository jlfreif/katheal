      The library transformed—no longer dim and dying but radiant and alive. Every story glows
      with golden threads, complete and true. Books and scrolls float serenely, their endings
      finally written. Noah stands in the center, hands cupped to receive a gift from the library
      itself: a small golden quill that writes in light, pulsing with the rhythm of story-magic.
      Around him, completed stories dance in celebration. The threads weave beautiful patterns.
      His expression shows joy and humble gratitude. A doorway of golden light opens before him,
      leading back home. The atmosphere is triumphant but gentle, celebrating not just success
      but understanding.

      The library blazed with completed stories, every thread golden and strong. The scroll Noah
      had saved first floated down to him, whole and beautiful, then transformed into a small
      quill made of light. He understood. This was Kathaél's gift—the quill that wrote truth
      instead of perfection, that helped stories find their own way. All his failed attempts had
      led here. The doorway home shimmered open, and he was ready.

    visual: |
      Noah walks through the forest toward home, the golden quill tucked behind his ear like a
      pencil, glowing softly. He moves with confident strides, no longer hunched with the weight
      of needing to be perfect. Golden threads appear faintly in the air around him, connecting
      to trees and flowers, showing stories in everything. He grins widely, already composing in
      his head—not the perfect story, but a true one. Small creatures peek out to watch him pass.
      The path ahead is clear and welcoming. His whole demeanor radiates understanding and
      excitement. The atmosphere celebrates the journey and anticipates the next beginning.

      Noah walked home carrying the quill and a new understanding. Stories needed tries, not
      triumph. Failures weren't wasted—they were information, each attempt teaching what worked
      and what didn't. The quill glowed warm behind his ear, reminding him that persistence mattered
      more than perfection. He couldn't wait to get back to his laptop, to try again with fresh
      eyes and a braver heart.
