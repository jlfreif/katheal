  Noah stands in the same central nexus of the Heart-Loom, but everything has
  transformed. The hundreds of golden threads now weave together in a beautiful,
  coherent pattern—spiraling, intersecting, supporting each other in a design that
  looks both intentional and organic. Noah's own thread is visible, integrated into
  the tapestry, glowing bright as it connects to dozens of other threads. He holds
  both hands up at chest height, palms facing each other, and suspended between them
  hovers a small, beautiful object: a golden quill made of pure light, gift from the
  Heart-Loom itself. His expression is one of quiet wonder and accomplishment—not
  arrogant pride, but genuine recognition that he did something that mattered. His
  eyes are bright, a slight smile on his face, and there's a new ease in his posture,
  a confidence that wasn't forced. Around him, the light is radiant and warm. Small
  particles of golden dust drift through the air like pollen or gentle snow. The
  forest beyond the nexus is visible now, no longer obscured by fog or doubt—clear
  and beautiful. The path leading away from the nexus glows softly, inviting but not
  rushing him. In the background, barely visible but definitely there, is a glimpse
  of the ordinary world waiting for his return.

  The tapestry accepted his truth, and the whole pattern glowed stronger. Noah received a quill of light—proof that honest stories matter.
