      The forest library transformed. No longer dim and dying. Radiant. Alive. Every story glows with
      golden threads. Books and scrolls float on tree branches, complete and true. Noah stands in the
      center, hands cupped. The library gives him a gift. A small golden quill that writes in light.
      Pulsing with story-magic. Around him, completed stories dance. The threads weave beautiful patterns.
      His expression shows joy and gratitude. A doorway of golden light opens between the trees. Leading
      home. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The forest library blazed. Every thread golden. Every story complete. The scroll Noah saved first floated down. Whole. Beautiful. It transformed. Became a small quill made of light. Kathaél's gift. The quill that wrote truth instead of perfection. "All my failures led here," he whispered. The doorway home shimmered between the trees.

    visual: |
      Noah walks through the forest away from the library. The golden quill tucked behind his ear like
      a pencil. Glowing softly. He moves with confident strides. No longer hunched. Golden threads appear
      faintly in the air. Connecting trees and flowers. Showing stories in everything. He grins. Already
      composing. Not the perfect story. A true one. Small creatures peek out. The path ahead clear and
      welcoming. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah left the forest library behind. The golden quill glowed behind his ear. Golden threads appeared faintly. Connecting everything. Stories everywhere. Stories needed tries, not triumph. Failures weren't wasted. They were information. Each attempt teaching. The quill glowed warm. Persistence mattered more than perfection.
