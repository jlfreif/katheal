description: Noah journeys home through the transformed Whispering Woods, receives Bramblebeard's acorn gift, and reunites with Ellie in the meadow where they share their treasures and plan to plant the acorn together.

  Noah and Ellie sit together in the meadow, heads bent over her sketchbook. Noah pulls out
  Bramblebeard's acorn—still glowing faintly—and places it gently in Ellie's palm. Her eyes
  widen with wonder. "It's magic," she breathes. Noah smiles. "It's possibility. Want to plant
  it together?" Behind them, the Whispering Woods rustle with approval. New adventures await,
  but for now, they're home.

  The woods guided Noah home, but not because they showed him the way—because he knew it now.
  The Luminary Fox watched from the shadows, satisfied. Bramblebeard waited at the Grove,
  offering a glowing acorn: "For one who learned to navigate by heart." "You return different,"
  Bramblebeard observed. Noah nodded. "I found what I was looking for." The giant smiled. "No.
  You became it." Noah stepped into the golden meadow where Ellie waited, and they ran to
  embrace. "You found it!" she called. Noah hugged her tight. "I found me. And I couldn't have
  done it without you." Ellie studied the glowing acorn, then looked at Noah with that familiar
  spark. "What happens if we plant it?" Noah grinned. "We find out. Together."
