      The Crystal blazes like a star, every facet glowing. Noah's thread flows into
      the story-facet, finding its place in the crystalline structure. Light refracts
      through every facet in rainbow colors. Noah holds both hands at chest height,
      and between them hovers a single blank page glowing with soft golden light.
      The fox from earlier watches from the edge, approving.

      The Crystal blazed like a star, every facet glowing. Noah's thread wove itself
      into the pattern, finding an ending that surprised and delighted him. The fox
      sat nearby, tail swishing. Light gathered in Noah's palms, warm and tingly, until
      a blank page appeared—glowing with possibility. "A beginning," he breathed. "Not
      an ending."

    visual: |
      Noah walks along a glowing path, the blank page tucked against his chest.
      Around him, frozen story-threads complete themselves one by one, words
      blooming like flowers. The forest feels alive. His ordinary world glows
      warmly in the distance.

      All around him, stories finished themselves with gentle chime sounds. Threads
      that had hung frozen finally found their endings. The rabbit hopped past and
      Noah laughed, giddy with relief and joy. "Thank you," he called to the forest.
      He hoped the girl at the crossroads could feel this too. The blank page warmed
      against his heart as he walked home.
