shared_theme_key: discovering_authentic_approach

theme_description: |
  Both Max and Maya discover that authentic expression matters more than forced perfection.
  They each find their own way to connect with Kathaél's magic by being themselves rather
  than trying to follow rules or formulas.

symbolic_motif:
  name: flickering_lantern
  description: A lantern that brightens when someone is being authentic and dims when they're forcing it
  meaning: Authenticity creates light; pretense creates darkness

scenario_variants:
  - character_code: mx
    location: A workshop filled with broken inventions and failed experiments
    challenge_description: |
      Max faces a room full of his failed attempts to solve Kathaél's problems through
      logic and formulas. He realizes his analytical approach has been missing something:
      genuine curiosity rather than need for perfect answers.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern hangs in the workshop, flickering dimly when Max tries to force solutions
      through pure logic. When he allows himself to explore playfully, curious about what
      might happen rather than what should happen, the lantern blazes bright.

  - character_code: ma
    location: A gallery of faded paintings that need color and life
    challenge_description: |
      Maya enters a space where her attempts to paint "correctly" have failed. She realizes
      that being bold and authentic in her art matters more than following artistic rules.
    motif_manifestation: |
      A lantern illuminates the gallery, dimming when Maya tries to paint what she thinks
      she should paint. When she paints from her heart, wild and true, the lantern glows
      brilliantly and the paintings come alive.

world_connection: |
  This mirrored moment reflects Kathaél's response to sincerity. The realm strengthens
  when people bring their authentic selves, not when they try to be what they think
  they should be.
