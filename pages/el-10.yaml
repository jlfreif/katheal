description: Elise speaks aloud the truth she's always seen—that quiet observers hold the stories of the world—and her voice brings the paperbird back to life, fully restored and vibrant with all its colors.

  As Elise speaks, the flowers in the garden begin to glow, growing brighter with each word.
  The pool's surface ripples with light. Most importantly, the paperbird begins to solidify—
  its edges becoming crisp and clear, its colors flooding back brilliantly: sapphire blue,
  sunset gold, forest green, rose pink. It flies up in spirals of joy, wings catching starlight,
  fully alive again. Elise continues speaking her observations, her truths, and with each word
  the paperbird grows more vibrant. She's crying with relief and joy. Her voice saved it.

  Elise knelt at the pool's edge, the fading paperbird hovering just above the water, nearly
  transparent now—this is its last moment. Elise spoke, her voice gentle but clear: "I see you—
  made of whispered stories, quiet truths, observations no one thought to share. You carry what
  silent watchers know. And I see that matters." The paperbird blazed to life—colors flooding
  back in brilliant waves. Elise kept speaking: "Quiet voices matter. Gentle observations hold
  power. Small acts of care change worlds." The paperbird touched her sketchbook and words
  appeared—her words, her truths. "You gave me voice," it seemed to say. "Now accept your own."
  The garden celebrated—flowers blooming in waves of color, paperbirds singing in crystal harmonies.
  Elise smiled, tears on her cheeks. She'd found her voice. And it had always been enough.
