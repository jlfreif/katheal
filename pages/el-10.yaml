    visual: |
      Elise stands at the Heart Crystal's nexus, hundreds of faded golden threads
      converging around her. She stands quietly, hands at her sides with palms
      facing outward in an open, offering gesture. Inside her chest, visible through
      a soft transparency, a gentle light glows like candlelight. Her eyes are closed
      as if gathering courage.

      The Heart Crystal's center surrounded her, threads converging from every direction.
      Inside her chest, Elise felt her light: small and soft, like a candle, not
      a bonfire. She could almost hear herself thinking: it's not enough. But the
      threads leaned toward her hopefully. They seemed to be waiting for exactly
      what she carried.

    focus: Taking decisive action

    visual: |
      Elise extends her hands outward, palms up, as soft light spreads from her
      chest into the waiting threads. Her expression shows fear and determination
      mixed together, jaw trembling but stance holding steady. Around her, creatures
      of Kathaél have gathered in a circle, watching. The dim threads begin to
      brighten with gentle color.

      Elise opened her hands. She let her small, gentle light spread outward,
      expecting it to disappear like a candle in wind. Instead, the threads caught
      it. Passed it along. Her light touched one thread, which brightened, which
      touched another. Color spread like ripples in still water. Her light was
      exactly enough.
