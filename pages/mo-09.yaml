      Mona sits up from her rest, refreshed and smiling. Dawn light filters through the trees,
      creating golden beams. She looks around at all the threads she helped, now glowing
      brilliantly around the clearing. Her expression shows a moment of realization as she
      notices how the threads connect to each other, forming chains of light that lead upward.
      She stands, brushing moss from her clothes with determination. Her bunny sits propped
      against the tree. Small creatures gather again, sensing her renewed energy.

      Mona woke up as sun touched her face. She felt better, stronger. Looking around, she
      saw all the threads she'd helped, glowing bright and happy. Each one connected to another,
      and another. She stood up, not because she had to, but because she wanted to. There were
      still threads that needed a friend. And being a friend was what Mona did best.

    focus: Discovering the missed clue

    visual: |
      Mona stands in the center of the clearing with her arms spread wide in joy. Around her,
      the threads she helped glow so brightly they create streams of light flowing upward toward
      the Heart Crystal. These lower threads connect to higher threads, which connect to even
      higher ones, creating a luminous pathway she couldn't see before. The light travels up
      and up until it reaches the massive threads at the Crystal's peak, which begin to pulse
      with awakening light. Her face shows pure wonder and delight. The whole forest glows.

      Then she saw it. The threads she'd helped weren't just glowing for themselves. Their
      light flowed upward, touching other threads, which touched others, creating a river of
      light all the way to the top. She didn't need to reach the high threads herself. Her
      courage to try had started something that spread everywhere. "It works!" she shouted, spinning in a circle.
