      Mona stands up, bunny in one arm, seed pod in the other hand. She thinks about everything
      the garden taught her—puzzle pieces that glowed when questioned, symbols that froze when you
      committed, the fox's left-left-right pattern. She looks at the three spots carefully one more
      time. The middle one is closest to where the golden threads are brightest. It's a small detail,
      but it's something. She makes her choice. She toddles to the middle spot with determined steps.
      Maybe it's right, maybe it's wrong, but she investigated all she could and now she's trying.
      Her expression shows brave determination.

The middle one was near the brightest threads. Small clue. But something. She walked to it. Best guess. Time to try.

      Mona kneels and digs with her small hands, planting the seed in the middle spot. The moment
      it touches soil, golden light explodes upward! She chose right! The seed was meant for this
      exact spot—right above the Heart Crystal's deepest root. The small clue about the brightest
      threads was the hint she needed. The garden roars to life. Fountain splashing, flowers blooming,
      butterflies soaring. Golden threads blaze everywhere. The rabbit jumps with joy. Mona grins,
      exhausted but proud. She investigated, made her best guess, tried it, and succeeded! Her
      expression shows triumphant joy. The atmosphere celebrates victory through perseverance and
      smart guessing.
