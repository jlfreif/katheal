      Mona stands up, bunny in one arm, seed pod in the other hand. She looks at the garden—at
      all the spots she could plant it. She could question each one, analyze, compare, ask why
      forever. Or she could trust the feeling in her tummy. She closes her eyes, takes a breath,
      and feels where her feet want to walk. Not thinking. Just knowing. She toddles to a spot
      that feels right. Opens her eyes. This spot. Her expression shows calm determination mixed
      with trust in something deeper than logic. The atmosphere is quiet resolution.

      Mona stood. She could question every spot. Or she could trust her tummy. She closed her eyes. Felt where her feet wanted to go. Not thinking. Just knowing. She walked three steps. Stopped. This spot. Right here. She didn't know why. She just knew.

    visual: |
      Mona kneels and digs with her small hands, planting the seed in the spot her instinct chose.
      The moment it touches soil, golden light explodes upward. The seed was meant for this exact
      spot—right above the Heart Crystal's deepest root. All her questioning couldn't have found
      it, but her instinct knew. The garden roars to life. Fountain splashing, flowers blooming,
      butterflies soaring. Golden threads blaze everywhere. The tortoise appears, nodding approval.
      Mona realizes: questions help you learn, but instinct helps you choose. Both matter. Her
      expression shows joyful understanding. The atmosphere celebrates the integration of head
      and heart.

      Mona planted the seed. Golden light exploded. The seed belonged exactly here—right where her tummy told her. Questions taught her. But instinct chose for her. The garden blazed alive. Fountain splashing! Flowers blooming! The tortoise nodded. "You learned when to question and when to trust." Both mattered. Both were courage.
