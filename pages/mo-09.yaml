      Mona stands up in the Library, bunny in one arm, golden block in the other hand. She thinks about
      everything the Library taught her—blocks glowed when questioned, gentle hands for soft blocks,
      careful placement. She looks at the three spots on top of her tower one more time. The middle one
      has the tiniest dip—barely visible, but it's there! She saw it because she looked carefully. It's
      a small detail, but it's something. That's where the round block won't roll! She makes her choice.
      She toddles to the tower with determined steps, holding the block gently. Maybe it's right, maybe
      it's wrong, but she investigated all she could and now she's trying. Her expression shows brave
      determination.

      Mona reaches up and gently places the golden block in the middle spot on top of her tower. She
      places it right in the tiny dip. The moment it settles, the block STAYS! It doesn't roll! The
      whole tower lights up with golden glow, blazing upward through the Library! She chose right! The
      block fits perfectly in that little dip—the small clue she needed was there all along. The tower
      shines complete and beautiful. Golden threads blaze from her pedestal to the other four around
      the Heart Crystal. The rabbit jumps with joy. Mona grins, exhausted but proud. She asked why,
      looked carefully, made her best guess, tried gently, and succeeded! Her expression shows triumphant
      joy. The atmosphere celebrates victory through careful investigation and trying. Text in Times
