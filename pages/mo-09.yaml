      Mona sits in a circle with her gathered friends at the base of the cliff.
      The butterfly flutters above, the turtle gestures with one wise flipper,
      the bunny points up the cliff with its nose, and the flower-bells sway
      as if listening. Mona's glowing block sits in the center of the circle,
      pulsing brighter now. She's animated, gesturing with her little hands,
      her expression bright with new hope. The creatures lean in, engaged in
      planning.

      "How can we try together?" Mona asked. The butterfly spiraled up. "I could
      carry things!" The bunny thumped a strong hind leg. "I can make good jumps!"
      The turtle nodded slowly. "I can be steady steps that don't move." Even the
      flower-bells chimed softly, offering to hold vines. Mona's eyes got big and
      shiny. "Everyone trying makes new paths!" Her block glowed warmer, responding
      to her joy. Together they could do what one small girl couldn't do alone.

    focus: Working together toward the goal

    visual: |
      The creatures form a living, moving staircase up the cliff. The turtle
      provides the first steady steps. The bunny creates jumping platforms at
      mid-height. The butterfly carries a vine that the flower-bells hold,
      creating a handrail. Mona begins to climb, her glowing block blazing
      bright again, lighting the way. With each step she takes with her friends'
      help, color returns to that part of Kathaél—flowers blooming, stones
      brightening. Other children's voices call out in the distance.

      They built a path of trying! The turtle became steady steps. The bunny
      bounced up to make platforms. The butterfly strung flower-vines as handrails.
      Mona climbed, one wobbly step at a time, but never alone. Her friends tried
      with her. And with each step, light spread—flowers bloomed, colors returned,
      music played! From the top of the cliff, Mona could see other lights moving
      through Kathaél. Other children! Other helpers! Her heart jumped. "Try
      together!" she called out, and her voice echoed like a bell across the land.
