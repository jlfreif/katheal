      Mona stands up in the Library, bunny in one arm, golden star in the other hand. She thinks about
      everything the Library taught her—constellation pieces that glowed when questioned, patterns that
      froze when you committed, the fox's left-left-right rhythm. She looks at the three spots on the
      pedestal carefully one more time through the shimmering air. The middle one is closest to where
      the golden threads connecting the five pedestals are brightest. It's a small detail, but it's
      something. She makes her choice. She toddles to the middle spot with determined steps. Maybe it's
      right, maybe it's wrong, but she investigated all she could and now she's trying. Her expression
      shows brave determination. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona stood in the Library. She thought about everything she'd learned. Constellation pieces glowed when questioned. Patterns froze when you committed. The fox had a rhythm. She looked at the spots one more time. The middle one was near the brightest golden threads. Small clue. But something. She walked to it. Best guess. Time to try.

    visual: |
      Mona reaches up and places the golden star in the middle spot on the pedestal. The moment it
      touches, constellation light explodes upward through the Library! She chose right! The star was
      meant for this exact spot—right where the five pedestals' golden threads converged brightest. The
      small clue about the threads was the hint she needed. The constellation patterns roar to life
      across the Library ceiling. Stars connect. Patterns align. Golden threads blaze from her pedestal
      to the other four around the Heart Crystal. The rabbit jumps with joy. Mona grins, exhausted but
      proud. She investigated, made her best guess, tried it, and succeeded! Her expression shows
      triumphant joy. The atmosphere celebrates victory through perseverance and smart guessing. Text

Her small clue was enough. The constellations blazed alive across the ceiling. Stars connected! Patterns aligned! Golden threads linked to the other pedestals. The rabbit cheered. Mona grinned, tired and proud. She'd investigated. Made her best guess. Tried it. Won!
