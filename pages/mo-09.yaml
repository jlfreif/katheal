      Mona stands up, bunny still clutched in one arm, facing the tall slide with small but
      determined posture. She takes one toddler step forward, then another. Her face shows she's
      still scared—this isn't false courage, but real courage that acknowledges fear and moves
      forward anyway. She places one tiny hand on the slide's ladder. The atmosphere shifts from
      hesitation to action, from fear to courage-despite-fear.

      Mona stood up. Still scared. Tummy still fluttery. But brave didn't mean not scared. One hand on the ladder. "I try," she told bunny. "Even though scared."

      Mona begins climbing the ladder, one rung at a time, slow and careful. With each step she
      takes, the slide glows a little brighter, responding to her courage. Golden threads appear,
      supporting her like gentle hands. She looks down and realizes—she's been brave all along.
      Every new thing she tried in the playground taught her how to try this thing. The slide
      blazes with golden light, fully awake now because someone was finally brave enough to try
      it. Her expression shows surprised joy and accomplishment. The atmosphere explodes with
      celebration and breakthrough.

      Mona climbed. One rung. Then another. The slide glowed brighter with each step. Golden threads held her safe. At the top she looked down. She'd done it! Trying, even when scared. That's what courage was.
