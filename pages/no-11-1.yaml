      Noah walks back through the Whispering Woods as dawn breaks. The forest is transformed by
      morning light—or perhaps Noah is transformed in how he sees it. The paths that seemed so
      confusing now make perfect sense. Paperbirds greet him like old friends. The Luminary Fox
      appears briefly in the distance, nodding approval before vanishing. Noah carries no physical
      compass, but his steps are sure. His expression shows peaceful confidence.

      The woods guided Noah home, but not because they showed him the way—because he knew it now.
      Every tree, every turning held a lesson he'd carry forward. The Luminary Fox watched from the shadows, satisfied.

      As Noah reaches the forest edge, Bramblebeard waits at the Grove of Echoing Paths. The giant's
      expression has softened—almost proud. He holds out one massive hand, and in his palm rests a
      small acorn from the ancient oaks. "For one who learned to navigate by heart," Bramblebeard
      rumbles. Noah accepts it gently, understanding this is more than a seed—it's a promise of
      future growth.

      "You return different," Bramblebeard observed. Noah nodded, holding the acorn carefully.
      "I found what I was looking for." The giant smiled. "No. You became it."
