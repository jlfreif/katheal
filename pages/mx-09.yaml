      Max stands up from his slumped position, wiping his eyes, setting his jaw with determination.
      He picks up the broken clockwork mouse that moves in circles, studying it with fresh perspective.
      Around him, the failed experiments now look different—not like waste, but like learning.
      He grabs his tools again, not to fix something perfectly, but to try one more experiment.
      His posture straightens from defeated to curious. His expression shows renewed purpose mixed
      with humility. The atmosphere shifts from heavy to energized, possibility returning.

      Max pushed himself up. He wasn't done. Every failure had taught him something valuable—he
      just hadn't been paying attention to the lessons. He picked up the circling mouse, really
      looking at it this time. What if the "mistakes" were actually showing him something? What
      if he'd been so focused on the end goal that he'd missed the clues in the process? He
      grabbed his notebook. Time to try again. Differently this time.

      Max's eyes widen in realization as he looks back at his very first failed attempt—the gear
      that sparked golden. He'd dismissed it as wrong, but now he sees the spark pattern formed
      a rhythm, a heartbeat. He grabs that gear and places it in the clockwork deer's heart,
      not calculating, just feeling. Golden threads shimmer into visibility throughout the workshop,
      connecting all his failed experiments in a web of learning. The deer's thread glows brilliantly.
      Around him, the broken machines begin to hum softly. His expression shows amazed understanding.
      The atmosphere blazes with breakthrough joy.

      Max stared at his first failed experiment—the gear that had sparked wrong. Except it hadn't
      been wrong. The sparks had formed a pattern, a rhythm like a heartbeat. That was what the
      deer needed. Not perfect mechanism but genuine life. He placed the "failed" gear in the
      deer's heart. Golden threads blazed. The deer's eyes flickered. Every failed attempt had
      been teaching him this truth: magic valued trying over triumph.
