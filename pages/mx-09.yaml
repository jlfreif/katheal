      Max stands up, legs protesting. He rolls his shoulders, preparing to try again. His
      expression shows determination mixed with humor - "Take forty-seven. Let's do this." Maya
      raises an eyebrow. Max grins despite his exhaustion. "Persistence is my thing." He approaches
      the course differently this time - watching it like he watches a basketball game. Everything
      has timing. Everything has flow. The atmosphere shifts to determined creativity. Text in

      Max stood. His legs protested, but he ignored them. "Okay," he said, rolling his shoulders. "Take forty-seven. Let's do this." Maya raised an eyebrow. "Forty-seven?" Max grinned. "Persistence is my thing." He approached the course. This time, he watched the rhythm like a basketball game. Everything had timing. Everything had flow.

      Max moves through the course with a new fluidity - running drills combined with mime
      movements predicting the pattern. When obstacles shift, he adjusts mid-motion. His hands
      show him the rhythm before his feet follow. He's made it further than ever - seven obstacles,
      eight, nine. The threads around him sing with approval. The last obstacle shifts and instead
      of fighting it, he flows with it. Success! The course blazes gold. Text in Times New Roman

      Max moved through the course like he was running drills. When an obstacle shifted, he adjusted. When the path changed, he changed with it. He used mime movements to predict the next shift—his hands showing him the rhythm before his feet followed. The threads sang. He made it through seven obstacles. Eight. Nine. The last one shifted, and instead of fighting it, he flowed with it. Done. The course blazed gold.
