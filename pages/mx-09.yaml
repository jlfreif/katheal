      Max stands up in the Library, preparing to try again despite exhaustion. He rolls his shoulders,
      gathering his resolve. His expression shows determination mixed with insight—he's figured something
      out. "Okay. One more try." He approaches the sequences differently this time—watching them like he
      watches a basketball game in motion. Everything has timing. Everything has flow. Even change has
      patterns. His analytical mind combines with creative flexibility. The atmosphere shifts to determined
      creativity. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max stood. "Okay," he said. "One more try." He approached the sequences. This time, he watched the rhythm of the changes themselves. How fast they shifted. When they branched. The pattern of the adaptation. Everything had timing. Everything had flow. Even change followed patterns.

      Max moves through the sequences with a new fluidity—calculating rapidly but flowing with changes.
      When a sequence shifts, he adjusts mid-equation seamlessly. His hands move in the air, tracing
      mathematical patterns, predicting the next transformation before it happens. He's made it further
      than ever—seven sequences, eight, nine. The golden threads around him sing with approval. The
      last sequence requires simultaneous adaptation across multiple patterns at once. He does it, flowing
      between them. Success! The pedestal blazes gold. Golden threads connect to the other four pedestals
      across the Library. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max moved through the sequences like he was running drills. When a pattern shifted, he adjusted. When it branched, he changed with it. He predicted the rhythm of transformation—his mind showing him the next shift before it happened. The threads sang. He made it through seven sequences. Eight. Nine. The last one required adapting across multiple patterns simultaneously. He flowed between them. Done. The pedestal blazed gold. Golden threads connected to the other pedestals. Others were solving their challenges at the exact same moment. Together.
