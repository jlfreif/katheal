      Max stands, rain-soaked, and walks back toward the destroyed challenge.
      He picks up a broken piece of metal, testing its weight. His posture
      shows determination mixed with uncertainty. The bird from before watches
      with approval. His notebook lies closed on the ground—he's not following
      a system anymore.

      Max stood. He didn't know how to fix this. Didn't have a system or
      technique. But the thread was still there, weak but alive. He walked
      back to the wreckage and picked up a broken beam. Maybe he couldn't
      restore what was. But maybe he could build something new from the
      mistake. "Okay," he said to the wreckage. "Let's try."

    focus: Discovering the missed clue

    visual: |
      Max works with the broken pieces, not trying to rebuild the original
      perfectly but creating something new from the ruins. As he connects
      pieces, golden threads weave between them, stronger than before. A
      warmth spreads through the air—someone else's courage reaching him.
      The challenge begins glowing, different but alive.

      Max pieced together broken beams, twisted metal, collapsed ropes—not
      rebuilding what was, but making something new. The threads wove between
      his hands, humming. Warmth flooded through him, bright and unexpected,
      like someone far away was being brave at the exact same moment. The
      challenge glowed to life, different from the original but stronger.
      "Mistakes don't have to be endings," Max breathed.
