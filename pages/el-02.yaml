description: Elise follows the fading paperbird deeper into the woods, discovering other vibrant paperbirds in a grove, but reaches a three-way fork where she must choose a path—and only her careful observation can help.

  The paperbirds stop at a three-way fork in the path, where ancient standing stones mark
  each direction. The healthy paperbirds circle in confusion—they don't know which way to go.
  The fading paperbird drifts weakly, barely able to fly. Elise stands at the crossroads,
  anxious but thinking. Each stone has symbols carved in it, and she recognizes them from
  the writing on the paperbird's wings. She needs to choose a path, but which one? Her hands
  tremble slightly as she examines the stones, detail by detail.

  The woods were full of wonders Elise ached to draw—glowing mushrooms, singing flowers, trees
  that whispered. But the paperbird kept fading, colors growing dimmer. She had to keep going.
  Other paperbirds gathered in a grove, singing in crystalline voices. Next to them, Elise's
  paperbird looked almost transparent. They were trying to help, but something was still wrong.
  The paperbirds sang as they flew, their voices weaving a puzzle: "Voice, voice, voice." What
  did it mean? At the three-way fork, the paperbirds couldn't choose—they needed someone who
  could read the stones, notice the details. Elise felt scared but studied each symbol carefully.
  She had to get this right.
