    visual: |
      Elise stands between worlds, her fingertips touching a shimmering portal where
      her drawing transformed into a doorway of light. One foot lifts as she's gently
      pulled forward. Through the portal, a meadow appears with faded colors, flowers
      washed out like sun-bleached watercolors. A luminescent butterfly rests on her
      shoulder.

      When Elise touched the glowing flower, the paper opened like a door. Through
      it she saw a meadow, but something was wrong. The colors looked tired, like
      crayons left too long in the sun. Pink flowers that should have been bright
      were barely more than grey. Behind her, her bedroom faded to a whisper.

    visual: |
      Elise steps fully into Kathaél, standing in the faded meadow. Her ordinary
      bedroom has become translucent behind her. Golden threads from the Heart-Loom
      reach toward her, thin and dim. Her watercolor set hangs from her wrist. Her
      expression shows wonder and gentle concern as she surveys the colorless landscape.

    text: |
      Elise stepped through, and her room dissolved like morning mist. The meadow
      stretched around her, beautiful in shape but heartbreaking in color. Golden
      threads drifted overhead, faint as old cobwebs. She understood without being
      told: this world was losing something precious, and it had called to her. Maybe
      because she noticed things others missed.
