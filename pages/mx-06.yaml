      Max and Noah tackle a challenge course together, working in rhythm. Max jumps and climbs
      while Noah calls out patterns from beside the course. "Left! No, wait, right!" They're
      coordinating well but the course shifts beneath Max, causing him to fall. Both boys are on
      the ground, frustrated. Noah frowns at his notes, thinking. The course hums, having reset
      again. Max groans "It keeps CHANGING!" The atmosphere is one of being stuck on a problem.

      Max and Noah tackled a course together. Max handled the physical obstacles while Noah called out patterns he'd spotted. They worked in rhythm—Max jumping, Noah directing. "Left! No, wait, right!" They almost had it. Then the course shifted again. They both fell. Max groaned. "It keeps CHANGING!" Noah frowned at his notes. "Unless... what if changing is the point?"

      Max runs the course again, but this time with a different approach. When obstacles shift, he
      adjusts mid-jump, flowing with the changes instead of fighting them. He's adapted his
      direction mid-climb, showing athletic flexibility. The golden threads around him hum with
      approval. The course stays active, glowing. Noah watches with excitement, realizing the
      insight. Max lands with a triumphant expression. "That's it!" The atmosphere is breakthrough
      and understanding. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max stood. "Say that again." Noah's eyes lit up. "What if the course changes because we're supposed to adapt? Not solve it once, but keep adjusting?" Max tested it. He ran the course, and when obstacles shifted, he shifted too. Adjusted mid-jump. Changed direction mid-climb. The threads hummed. The course stayed active. "That's it!" Max laughed. "It's not about being perfect. It's about not giving up when things change!"
