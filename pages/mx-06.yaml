payoff: New approach is tried based on the insight from previous spread.

description: Max discovers that the course requires adaptation—not completing it once, but adjusting continuously as it changes.

      Max tackles a course together with Noah. Max handles the physical obstacles while Noah calls out
      patterns he's spotted. They work in rhythm—Max jumping, Noah directing. "Left! No, wait, right!"
      They almost have it. Then the course shifts again—the rope swing changes direction, the balance
      beam rotates. They both fall, landing on mats below. Max groans. "It keeps CHANGING!" Noah frowns
      at his notes. Max's expression shows frustrated realization—completing it once isn't the point.
      The course keeps changing. The fox watches patiently. The atmosphere is one of being stuck on a
      challenge that won't stay solved. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

    visual: |
      Max tries a different approach with the course. Instead of following a fixed path, he runs it and
      adjusts when obstacles shift. An obstacle changes position—he flows with it, adapting his jump
      mid-air. When the balance beam rotates, he changes direction mid-step instead of fighting it. The
      golden threads around him hum with approval. The course stays active, glowing steadily. Max's
      expression shows excited discovery—breakthrough understanding! The atmosphere celebrates insight.

      Max stood. "Say that again." Noah's eyes lit up. "What if the course changes because we're supposed to adapt? Not solve it once, but keep adjusting?" Max tested it. He ran the course, and when obstacles shifted, he shifted too. Adjusted mid-jump. Changed direction mid-climb. The threads hummed. The course stayed active. "That's it!" Max laughed. "It's not about being perfect. It's about not giving up when things change!"
