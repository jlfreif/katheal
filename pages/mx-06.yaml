      A cluttered workshop inside a hollow tree, shelves lined with broken gadgets and failed
      experiments. Half-finished contraptions litter the workbench: a device to catch golden
      threads that snapped them instead, a formula written on parchment that made things worse,
      a mechanical hand that froze mid-motion. Max stands in the center, surrounded by his
      failures, staring at a wall covered in calculations and diagrams. A small lantern hangs
      from the ceiling, its flame barely flickering, casting dim shadows across the mess. His
      expression shows frustration and dawning realization. The workshop feels cramped and
      suffocating, weighted with too much thinking and not enough doing.

      Max stared at his failed experiments, formulas scratched across every surface. He'd tried
      to solve Kathaél like a puzzle with one right answer. But nothing worked. The lantern above
      him guttered, barely alight, as if his forced logic dimmed it further. He grabbed another
      calculation, ready to try again the same way. The flame dimmed to almost nothing.

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Max sits on the floor of the workshop, abandoned formulas scattered around him, a playful
      smile on his face as he juggles three golden threads like a game. The threads shimmer and
      dance, responding to his movements. The lantern overhead blazes brilliantly now, bathing
      everything in warm golden light. Around him, the broken gadgets begin to hum and glow,
      responding to his shifted energy. One of the threads weaves itself into a new pattern,
      beautiful and unexpected, showing him something he never would have planned. His eyes are
      bright with genuine curiosity and delight. The workshop transforms from cluttered to magical.

      On impulse, Max dropped the formulas and just played. He juggled golden threads like they
      were toys, laughing when they sparkled. The lantern exploded with light. The threads wove
      themselves into patterns he never would have calculated—better patterns, alive and true.
      His experiments glowed, responding not to logic but to joy. That was it. Kathaél didn't
      need him to figure it out. It needed him to explore it.
