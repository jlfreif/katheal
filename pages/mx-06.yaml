    focus: Recognizing what doesn't work

    visual: |
      Max slumps against a training post in a rocky clearing, chest heaving.
      Around him, puzzle pieces from failed attempts scatter the ground. A
      challenge course shifts and reshapes itself behind him. A compass hangs
      from the post beside his head, its needle spinning wildly. His notebook
      lies closed at his feet.

      Max collapsed against the post, lungs burning. Every time he made a mistake, he'd started over from the beginning. Perfectly. But the course kept changing, and he kept failing. The compass beside him spun in frantic circles, pointing nowhere. He closed his eyes. "Maybe perfect isn't the answer."

    focus: Discovering a new pattern

    visual: |
      Max stands before the challenge course, and instead of restarting after
      a mistake, he keeps moving forward. Behind him, his footprints show a
      messy path with corrections and stumbles, but all moving forward. The
      compass's needle points steady and true directly at him. Golden threads
      pulse approval.

      Max stood and faced the course again. This time, when he stumbled on
      the third obstacle, he didn't restart. He caught himself, adjusted,
      and kept going. The course stopped shifting. The compass needle swung
      around and pointed straight at him, steady as stone. "Oh," Max breathed.
      "You don't want perfect. You want persistence."
