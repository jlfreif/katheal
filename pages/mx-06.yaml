# Max - Spread 6: Midpoint
# New insight / pattern - discovering the key to adaptive challenges

id: mx-06
spread: 6
node_type: mirrored
beat: "Midpoint: new insight / pattern"

hook: A pattern or clue emerges, suggesting a new direction based on observation.
payoff: New approach is tried based on the insight from previous spread.

description: Max discovers that the sequences require adaptation—not solving once, but adjusting continuously as they change.

      Max works on a floating sequence in the Library, numbers glowing around him. He solves a pattern
      correctly, filling in the missing numbers. But the sequence immediately shifts to a new pattern
      before he can complete it. He tries again. It shifts. Again. It shifts. Max's expression shows
      frustrated realization—solving it once isn't the point. The sequences keep changing. The fox
      watches patiently. Books hover nearby. His notes are covered in crossed-out solutions that were
      right but no longer apply. The atmosphere is one of being stuck on a problem that won't stay
      solved. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Max solved a sequence correctly. Then it shifted to a new pattern. He solved that. It shifted again. "It keeps CHANGING!" He stared at his notes—every solution was right. But none stayed right for long. The fox tilted its head. Max frowned. "Unless... what if changing is the point?"

    focus: Discovering a new pattern
    visual: |
      Max tries a different approach with the sequences. Instead of solving one completely then moving
      to the next, he adjusts his solution as the pattern shifts. A sequence changes from arithmetic
      to geometric—he flows with it, adapting his answer mid-calculation. When another sequence branches,
      he follows the new path instead of fighting it. The golden threads around him hum with approval.
      The sequences stay active, glowing steadily. Max's expression shows excited discovery—breakthrough
      understanding! The atmosphere celebrates insight. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at

      Max tested it. He solved a sequence, and when it shifted, he shifted too. Adapted his solution mid-calculation. Changed approach mid-pattern. The threads hummed. The sequence stayed active, glowing. "That's it!" Max laughed. "It's not about solving it once. It's about adapting when things change! The challenge IS the change!"
