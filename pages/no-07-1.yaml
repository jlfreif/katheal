      Noah emerges from the vine archway onto a mountain path. The path winds upward through
      thinning trees, leading toward a plateau bathed in golden afternoon light. His compass
      glows steadily, pointing upward. Noah climbs with new confidence, Ellie's lesson fresh in
      his heart. Behind him, the Whispering Woods spread out like a tapestry—he can see how far
      he's come. Ahead, mysterious standing stones mark the grove's entrance.

      Noah climbed higher, feeling different now—lighter. The compass wasn't just showing him
      where to go. It was showing him who he was becoming. Almost there.

      Noah reaches the Grove of Truth—a circle of ancient oaks surrounding a crystalline pool
      that reflects the sky perfectly. The compass pulses powerfully here, almost vibrating in
      his hands. Noah kneels at the pool's edge, gazing at his reflection. But something's
      wrong—the reflection shows not just him, but shadow-versions of all his fears and doubts
      swirling in the water. His expression shows realization: to find the truth, he must face
      himself.

      The pool showed Noah every fear he'd ever had—every wrong turn, every failed choice.
      His hands trembled. The compass glowed brighter. "Face what you need to face," the fox
      had said. But how?
