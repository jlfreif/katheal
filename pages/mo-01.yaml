      Mona's playroom in her New York City apartment, colorful foam mats on the floor, toys
      scattered in cheerful chaos. Mona (2 years old, wavy short dark brown ringlets, wearing
      light blue overalls with brooklyn shirt and white sneakers) sits surrounded by wooden blocks,
      stacking them with intense toddler concentration. Her chunky hands place blocks carefully,
      tongue between teeth in focus. Some blocks already stacked, others waiting their turn. A
      stuffed bunny watches nearby. Sunlight streams through the window. Her expression shows
      pure joy in simple play. The scene captures toddler life: exploring, experimenting,
      delighting in small accomplishments.

      Mona stacked blocks. Red block. Blue block. Yellow block. She clapped when the tower stood tall.

      The blocks begin to glow with soft golden light. Mona pulls her hands back, eyes going
      wide with amazement and a touch of uncertainty. The blocks start stacking themselves,
      floating gently into the air, building a tower taller than any she could reach. Golden
      threads connect the blocks, making them dance and spin. One block hovers in front of her
      face, glowing warm and friendly, as if inviting her to play a new game. Her expression
      shifts from surprise to delighted curiosity—that toddler moment of "what's THIS?!" The
      atmosphere sparkles with gentle magic designed not to frighten but to invite.

      The blocks glowed gold and floated up. They stacked themselves higher and higher, spinning. One floated close and giggled. "Play?" Mona asked the glowing block.
