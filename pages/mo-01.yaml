      Mona sits on a soft, colorful mat at Gymboree, surrounded by blocks, toys,
      and other toddlers playing nearby. She's stacking blocks into a wobbly tower,
      tongue poking out in concentration. Her dark curly hair frames her face as
      she carefully places one more block on top. The room is bright and cheerful
      with primary colors everywhere. Parents chat in the background.

      Mona placed a red block on top of the blue one. The tower wobbled. She
      held her breath, eyes wide. It stayed! She clapped her hands and giggled,
      then knocked the whole thing down with one happy swipe. Crash! Blocks
      scattered across the mat. A teacher smiled at her. "Good building, Mona!"
      Building was fun. Knocking down was even more fun!

    focus: First hint of something different

    visual: |
      Mona's head tilts to one side, her signature curious expression, as she
      notices something strange. Among her familiar blocks sits a glowing cube
      that pulses with soft golden light. It's the same size as her other blocks
      but shimmers like starlight. Her hand reaches toward it tentatively. The
      other toys and children fade slightly into the background as this mysterious
      block draws all her attention.

      Something glowed in the toy pile. Mona crawled closer, head tilted. A block
      she'd never seen before sat there, all shimmery and warm-looking. Not red,
      not blue—more like sunshine got turned into a toy. She reached out one
      finger and touched it. Tingles! Like bubbles on her skin. The block hummed
      a little song just for her. Mona's eyes got big and round. "Ooh!" She picked
      it up. It was warm and happy in her hands, and it wanted to show her something.
