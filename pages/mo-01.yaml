      Mona (2 years old, dark curly hair, bright curious eyes, medium height for her age)
      sits on a colorful play mat in a sunny New York City apartment. Wooden blocks scatter
      around her as she builds a wobbly tower. Sunlight streams through a large window showing
      city buildings outside. Toys dot the floor around her: stuffed animals, picture books, a
      small xylophone. She tilts her head, looking at something just beyond the window where
      the light seems to shimmer strangely. Her expression shows pure curiosity.

      Mona stacked another block on her tower, giggling when it wobbled but stayed up. She
      loved making things. Her apartment was full of sunshine and toys and places to explore.
      But something caught her eye near the window. The light didn't look quite right, like
      it was dancing when nothing moved.

    visual: |
      Mona stands close to the window where a shimmering portal of golden light has appeared,
      hovering in the air like a vertical pool of sunshine. Her small hand reaches toward it,
      fingers spread wide with wonder. Golden threads drift out from the portal, floating past
      her face like gentle fireflies. The normal city view through the window contrasts sharply
      with the magical shimmer. Her eyes are wide with delight, mouth open in an excited "oh!"
      The portal pulses softly, inviting and warm.

      Mona toddled closer. The strange light grew brighter, forming a doorway made of pure
      sunshine. Golden threads floated through it like birthday ribbons. She'd never seen
      anything so pretty. Her hand stretched out, and the moment her fingers touched the
      light, everything changed.
