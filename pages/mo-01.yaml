      Mona's playroom in her New York City apartment, colorful foam mats on the floor, toys
      scattered in cheerful chaos. Mona (2 years old, Caucasian with fair skin, wavy short dark
      brown ringlets, wearing light blue overalls with white shirt and white sneakers) sits surrounded by toys, picking
      up each one and tilting her head—her signature curious look. She examines a block. "Why
      square?" She touches her bunny. "Why soft?" She points at the window. "Why bright?" Her
      parents smile from the doorway. Her expression shows pure toddler curiosity. The scene
      captures her natural investigative nature—everything is a question waiting to be asked.

      Mona picked up a block. "Why square?" She touched her bunny. "Why soft?" She looked at the window. "Why bright?" Everything had a why. Asking felt good. Like unlocking tiny doors.

      One of Mona's blocks begins to glow with soft golden light. She picks it up, tilting her
      head in that curious way. "Why glow?" she asks it. And impossibly, it answers back—not
      in words but in feeling and light. The block pulses warmly, and suddenly all her toys start
      glowing faintly, each one humming with questions of its own. Golden threads weave between
      them. A doorway of light appears in her wall. Her expression shows delighted amazement—
      something finally answered! The atmosphere sparkles with the magic of questions meeting
      answers.

      Mona held a glowing block. "Why glow?" The block pulsed warm, like it was trying to answer. Then all her toys glowed. Golden threads appeared. A door made of light opened in her wall. Mona gasped. Something was finally answering her questions. She toddled toward the light.
