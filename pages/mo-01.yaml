      Mona's playroom in her New York City apartment, colorful foam mats on the floor, toys
      scattered in cheerful chaos. Mona (2 years old, wavy short dark brown ringlets, wearing
      light blue overalls with brooklyn shirt and white sneakers) sits surrounded by wooden blocks,
      stacking them with intense toddler concentration. Her chunky hands place blocks carefully,
      tongue between teeth in focus. Some blocks already stacked, others waiting their turn. A
      stuffed bunny watches nearby. Sunlight streams through the window. Her expression shows
      pure joy in simple play. The scene captures toddler life: exploring, experimenting,
      delighting in small accomplishments.

      Mona stacked blocks, one on top of another, tongue sticking out as she concentrated. Red
      block. Then blue. Then yellow. She clapped when they didn't fall. "Tower!" she announced
      proudly to her bunny. Building things was fun. Each block was a new try, a new challenge.
      Sometimes they fell. That was okay. She just tried again.

      The blocks begin to glow with soft golden light. Mona pulls her hands back, eyes going
      wide with amazement and a touch of uncertainty. The blocks start stacking themselves,
      floating gently into the air, building a tower taller than any she could reach. Golden
      threads connect the blocks, making them dance and spin. One block hovers in front of her
      face, glowing warm and friendly, as if inviting her to play a new game. Her expression
      shifts from surprise to delighted curiosity—that toddler moment of "what's THIS?!" The
      atmosphere sparkles with gentle magic designed not to frighten but to invite.

      The blocks glowed gold and floated up all by themselves. Mona's eyes got big. "Whoa!" The
      blocks stacked higher and higher, spinning and dancing in the air. One floated close to her
      face, warm and friendly. She reached out with one finger to touch it. The block giggled—
      actually giggled—and bobbed like it wanted to play. New things were sometimes scary. But
      also exciting. "Play?" she asked the glowing block.
