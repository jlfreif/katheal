      Mona's playroom in her New York City apartment, colorful foam mats on the floor, toys
      scattered in cheerful chaos. Mona (2 years old, Caucasian with fair skin, wavy short dark
      brown ringlets, wearing light blue overalls with white shirt and white sneakers) sits surrounded by toys, picking
      up each one and tilting her head—her signature curious look. She examines a block. "Why
      square?" She touches her bunny. "Why soft?" She points at the window. "Why bright?" Her
      parents smile from the doorway. Her expression shows pure toddler curiosity. The scene
      captures her natural investigative nature—everything is a question waiting to be asked.

      Mona asked why. "Why square?" she said. "Why soft?" she asked. "Why bright?" Why, why, why! Mona loved asking why.

      One of Mona's blocks begins to glow with soft golden light. She picks it up, tilting her
      head in that curious way. "Why glow?" she asks it. And impossibly, it answers back—not
      in words but in feeling and light. The block pulses warmly, and suddenly all her toys start
      glowing faintly, each one humming with questions of its own. Golden threads weave between
      them. A doorway of light appears in her wall. Her expression shows delighted amazement—
      something finally answered! The atmosphere sparkles with the magic of questions meeting
      answers.

      The block glowed! "Why glow?" Mona asked. The block got warm. All the toys glowed! A light door opened. Mona walked to it.
