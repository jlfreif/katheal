      Noah pushes through hanging moss and emerges into a moonlit glade—even though it's still
      afternoon, this place exists in perpetual twilight. In the center, perched on a fallen log
      covered in glowing lichen, sits the Luminary Fox. The fox glows faintly blue-silver, fur
      rippling with starlight. Its eyes are ancient and knowing. Noah stops, breath caught,
      compass held out like an offering. Fireflies orbit the fox like tiny satellites.

      The Luminary Fox appeared like moonlight made solid—glowing, impossible, beautiful.
      "You seek direction," it said, voice like wind chimes. "But do you seek the easy path or the true one?"

      The Luminary Fox circles Noah slowly, leaving trails of silver light. Noah turns to follow
      its movement, confused but fascinated. The fox speaks, and its words form visible shimmer
      in the air: "The needle points not to destinations, but to decisions." Noah's expression
      shows concentration—trying to decode the riddle. His compass glows in response to the fox's
      presence, needle trembling. Behind them, the glade fills with soft blue luminescence.

      "I don't understand," Noah admitted, frustrated. The fox's eyes gleamed. "The compass shows
      what you need to face, not what you want to find. Follow it anyway." Then it vanished,
      leaving only starlight and riddles.
