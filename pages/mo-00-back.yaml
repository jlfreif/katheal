      Back cover design with soft watercolor background in gentle blues, warm creams,
      and soft pinks. Golden threads create a playful, gentle border around the edges,
      weaving into simple shapes like stars, hearts, and circles. A small facet of the
      Heart Crystal glows softly in the upper corner, casting warm rainbow glows. The
      golden threads form decorative frames for the text areas. At the bottom, tiny
      silhouettes of six children (representing all the characters) stand together,
      connected by shimmering golden threads. The overall atmosphere is warm, gentle,
      and inviting—perfect for the youngest reader. Delicate ink linework adds soft
      detail to the magical elements. Space in the center is left clear for text placement.
