      Noah emerges into a small clearing where bioluminescent flowers grow in spiral patterns.
      The flowers pulse with soft blue-green light, creating a magical atmosphere. In the center
      of the clearing stands an ancient stone marker covered in the same swirling symbols as the
      compass. Noah approaches it carefully, one hand extended. The compass in his other hand
      glows brighter, resonating with the stone. Fireflies orbit the marker like tiny planets.

      The compass led him to a glowing grove marked by ancient stone. As Noah touched it,
      symbols lit up—matching the engravings on his compass perfectly. But what did they mean?

      Beyond the stone marker, three distinct paths branch out—each disappearing into different
      parts of the forest. The left path climbs upward toward rocky cliffs shrouded in mist. The
      middle path descends into a hollow filled with glowing mushrooms and strange sounds. The
      right path winds through a thicket of thorny vines with beautiful silver flowers. Noah
      stands frozen, compass in hand, but the needle spins wildly, unable to choose. His
      expression shows panic—which way is right?

      Three paths. Three choices. And the compass—his one guide—spun uselessly in circles.
      Noah's breath caught. "Just pick one for me!" he whispered. But the compass gave no answer.
