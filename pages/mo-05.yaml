      A maze of pathways deeper in the Library where constellation patterns keep changing. Mona stands
      at a junction watching a clever-looking chameleon stuck at a crossroads. The constellation markers
      shift and rearrange—the Bear becomes the Hunter, connecting lines swap places, star patterns
      reverse direction. "This constellation puzzle is impossible!" the chameleon says, changing colors
      frantically. "Every time I figure out the pattern, it changes!" Glowing stars dance and shift
      around them in the Library air. Other creatures watch, stumped. The atmosphere shows a genuinely
      tricky challenge—not overthinking, but a puzzle that actively fights back. Text in Times New Roman

    visual: |
      Mona watches the shifting constellation patterns carefully, tilting her head. "Why does it change?"
      she asks. Then she notices—the puzzle only shifts when someone hesitates! The moment the chameleon
      pauses to overthink, the constellations rearrange. Mona grins. She's figured out the trick through
      investigation! She picks a constellation path quickly based on what she's learned, commits, and
      toddles forward without stopping to second-guess. The patterns freeze in place—they can't change
      if you're already moving with confidence! The path stays solid under her feet. The chameleon gasps.
      "You solved it!" Mona learned the puzzle's secret rule through investigation, then beat it with
      quick action. The atmosphere celebrates outsmarting a genuinely tricky challenge. Text in Times

      Mona looked. "Why does it change?" She saw it! It moved when you stopped! Mona walked fast. No stopping! The stars froze! They couldn't move! "You did it!" said the chameleon. Ask why, then go!
