      A maze of paths where each fork has a glowing question mark on one side and an exclamation
      point on the other. Mona stands at a junction, uncertain. A clever-looking chameleon appears,
      changing colors constantly, looking very confident. "I have the perfect system!" it announces.
      "I can tell you exactly when to question and when to act." It pulls out a complicated chart
      with arrows and boxes. Mona tilts her head, trying to understand. The chart looks very
      impressive. Other creatures gather, listening. The atmosphere is one of false wisdom masking
      confusion.

      A maze of choices. Question marks and exclamation points everywhere. A chameleon appeared, colors shifting. "I know the secret! Follow my system—ask three questions, then take two actions, unless it's cloudy, then reverse it." It showed a complicated chart.

      Mona watches as the chameleon demonstrates its "perfect system" at a crossroads. It counts
      on its claws, checks the chart, changes colors nervously, counts again, looks at the sky,
      recounts... and never actually moves. It's been standing at the same fork for hours, trapped
      by its own system. "I'm still calculating!" it insists, but it's obviously stuck. Mona
      realizes the chart is just another way of not deciding. She walks past the frozen chameleon
      and chooses a path herself—questioning if it looks safe, then acting by walking it. The
      atmosphere shows that overthinking systems can be as paralyzing as endless questions.

      The chameleon demonstrated. Count. Check chart. Change color. Count again. Check sky. It never moved. Still stuck at the same choice. "I'm calculating!" But it hadn't gone anywhere in hours. Mona walked past it. That wasn't wisdom. That was just fear wearing a fancy chart.
