      Deeper in the Library, Mona finds a new pedestal with very different blocks. These blocks aren't
      solid—they're made of fluffy clouds, dripping water drops, and shimmering light beams! A clever
      chameleon sits frustrated by a pile of cloud blocks. "These blocks won't stack!" it says, changing
      colors frantically. "They're too soft! They fall through my hands!" The cloud blocks float gently,
      the water drops slip and slide, the light beams shimmer and shift. Other creatures watch, stumped.
      This is much harder than regular blocks. The atmosphere shows a genuinely tricky challenge.

      Mona found weird blocks! Cloud blocks! Water blocks! Light blocks! A chameleon sat there. "These blocks won't stack! Too soft!" The cloud blocks floated. The water dripped.

      Mona watches the cloud blocks carefully, tilting her head. "Why soft?" she asks gently. Then she
      tries something different—instead of grabbing hard, she cups her hands softly. The cloud block
      settles into her palms! She places it down very gently. It stays! She tries a water drop block
      next—asks "Why wet?" and notices it needs to be placed slowly so it doesn't splash. Gentle touch.
      Slow movement. The blocks stack when treated kindly! Mona grins. She figured out the trick—soft
      blocks need soft hands! The tower grows, fluffy and glowing. The chameleon gasps. "You did it!
      You were gentle!" The atmosphere celebrates outsmarting a tricky challenge with kindness. Text
