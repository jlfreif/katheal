      A maze of paths where the rules keep changing. Mona stands at a junction watching a clever-
      looking chameleon stuck at a crossroads. The path markers shift and rearrange—question marks
      become exclamation points, symbols swap places, arrows reverse direction. "This puzzle is
      impossible!" the chameleon says, changing colors frantically. "Every time I figure out the
      pattern, it changes!" Glowing symbols dance and shift around them. Other creatures watch,
      stumped. The atmosphere shows a genuinely tricky challenge—not overthinking, but a puzzle
      that actively fights back.

    visual: |
      Mona watches the shifting symbols carefully, tilting her head. "Why does it change?" she asks.
      Then she notices—the puzzle only shifts when someone hesitates! The moment the chameleon pauses
      to think, the symbols rearrange. Mona grins. She's figured out the trick! She picks a path
      quickly, commits, and walks forward without stopping to second-guess. The symbols freeze in
      place—they can't change if you're already moving! The path stays solid under her feet. The
      chameleon gasps. "You solved it!" Mona learned the puzzle's secret rule through investigation,
      then beat it with quick action. The atmosphere celebrates outsmarting a genuinely tricky
      challenge.

      Mona watched closely. "Why does it change?" Then she saw it—the puzzle shifted when you hesitated! The chameleon kept pausing, so it kept changing. Mona picked a path and walked. No hesitation. The symbols froze! They couldn't change while she moved. "You figured it out!" the chameleon said. Investigation then action. Both mattered.
