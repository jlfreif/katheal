    focus: The stakes become clearer

    visual: |
      Mona stands at the edge of a garden filled with enormous flower-bells,
      each taller than a grown-up. The flowers are gray and silent, hanging
      limp on their stems. Musical notes float frozen in the air around them
      like ice crystals. Mona looks tiny in comparison, craning her neck to
      see the tops of the flowers. Her glowing block pulses urgently. A wise
      old turtle sits nearby on a rock, watching her with ancient eyes.

      The garden was full of giant flower-bells, taller than any grown-up Mona
      knew. But they weren't singing. A turtle as old as stories blinked at her.
      "The Singing Flowers forgot their music," he said slowly. "They ring when
      someone tries their game—hopscotch on the colored stones. But the stones
      are far apart. Too far for little legs." The turtle looked sad. "No one's
      been brave enough to try in a very long time."

    focus: Accepting the difficult path

    visual: |
      Mona approaches the first colored stone, which is far from the second one—
      a distance that would be a normal step for an older child but is a big
      leap for a toddler. She stands at the edge, looking at the gap, her
      expression showing both uncertainty and determination. Her hands curl into
      little fists. The glowing block sits on the first stone, encouraging her.
      The gray flower-bells loom overhead, waiting. A tiny spark of color appears
      at the base of the nearest flower.

      Mona toddled to the first stone. Red! She loved red. But the next stone—
      yellow—was so far away. Too far for her little legs. She looked at the
      gap, then at the sad gray flowers, then at her glowing block. It hummed:
      You can try! Mona took a big breath. Mama said trying was how you learned.
      Maya said courage made colors stay. Mona didn't know if she could jump
      that far. But she could try! She bent her knees, wiggled her bottom, and—
      jumped!
