      Mona stands at the entrance to a crystalline cave where massive facets of the Heart Crystal
      form the walls, creating rainbow prisms of light. Deep inside, golden threads hang motionless
      in the shadows. The cave mouth towers above her small form. She holds a glowing mushroom in
      one hand like a tiny lantern, its soft blue light illuminating her determined face. The
      contrast between the bright entrance and dark interior creates dramatic lighting. Small
      crystal formations jut from the ground like miniature forests.

      Mona followed the threads to a place she'd never seen before. A cave made of giant
      crystals stretched into darkness. So many threads hung inside, all dim and still. It
      looked scary, but Mona had learned that new things were usually just different, not bad.
      She picked up a glowing mushroom and walked in, her light bobbing with each toddling step.

    focus: Encountering misleading help

    visual: |
      Inside the cave, a magnificent fox with fur that sparkles like diamonds stands on a crystal
      outcropping above Mona. The fox gestures dramatically with one paw at the dim threads,
      its expression confident and showy. Mona looks up at the fox, tilting her head skeptically.
      The fox's sparkling appearance contrasts with the genuine soft glow of Mona's mushroom.
      Behind them, threads hang waiting. The fox's shadow looms large on the crystal wall,
      making it seem more impressive than it is.

      A sparkling fox appeared on the rocks above. "You want those threads bright again? Easy!
      Just shake them really hard!" The fox demonstrated with wild pawing motions. Mona watched,
      head tilted. At home, shaking things too hard made them break. She looked at the fox, then
      at the threads. "Gentle better," she said quietly. The fox huffed. "Suit yourself, little one."
