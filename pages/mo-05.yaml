      A grand garden with elaborate fountains and ornate statues, much fancier than the simple
      playground. Mona toddles in looking tiny among the big fancy things. A magnificent peacock
      struts around, tail feathers fully displayed in brilliant blues and greens, showing off
      proudly. It preens and poses, very impressed with itself. Mona watches with wide eyes—
      the peacock is so pretty and confident. Other creatures watch the peacock but nothing is
      actually happening or moving. The atmosphere is all show, no substance.

      A peacock strutted around showing its tail. "Look at me! I'm so brave!" It posed and preened. Mona tilted her head. Looking brave wasn't the same as being brave.

      The peacock demonstrates its "bravery" by showing off more, strutting and posing, but when
      Mona points at a new toy to try, the peacock backs away nervously. "Oh, I don't actually
      TRY new things," it says, tail drooping. "I just look like I would." Mona's expression
      shows toddler confusion turning to understanding. She looks from the posing peacock to the
      untried toy and back. The peacock's beautiful feathers suddenly seem less impressive. A
      golden thread appears faintly near the toy, not the peacock. The atmosphere shifts from
      impressive to empty.

      "Show me!" Mona said, pointing at a new toy. "Oh no, I don't actually TRY things," the peacock said. "Too scary." Mona toddled toward the toy herself. Real brave meant real trying.
