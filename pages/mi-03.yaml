# Micah - Spread 3: First Attempt
# Emotional beat: CONFIDENCE → FRUSTRATION
# Escalation: Micah's usual approach (constant movement) makes things worse
# World rule hint: Frantic energy can't fix what needs stillness

id: mi-03
spread: 3
node_type: solo
beat: "Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)"

hook: Simple solutions fail, prompting the question of who might have better answers.
payoff: A wise helper appears who offers new perspective or guidance.

description: Micah confidently tries to fix the failing threads through movement and physical energy—running beneath them, jumping to reach them, spinning to redirect them—but each action makes them flicker faster.

    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Micah leaps high into the air, arms stretched toward a cluster of dimming golden
      threads overhead. His athletic form is fully extended in an impressive jump. But
      the threads scatter away from his touch like startled birds, flickering more
      frantically. Other threads he's already touched lie on the ground, pulsing erratically.
      His face shows determination mixed with confusion.

      "I've got this." Micah sprinted beneath the threads and jumped, reaching high.
      But they scattered from his fingers like scared fish. "Okay, different approach."
      He tried running in patterns, creating wind to guide them. The threads flickered
      faster, more unstable. He spun beneath them, redirecting his energy upward. Two
      more snapped and fell. "Come on!"

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work

    visual: |
      Micah stands still for the first time, breathing hard, surrounded by fallen threads
      that pulse weakly on the mossy ground. More threads overhead flicker dangerously.
      His shoulders slump slightly—unusual for him. A small luminous moth circles his
      head slowly, deliberately, its wings beating in a calm, steady rhythm that contrasts
      with his frantic energy.

      Micah stopped, chest heaving. More threads had fallen. His usual approach—move
      faster, try harder, never stop—wasn't working. A glowing moth circled his head,
      wings beating slow and steady. It landed on his shoulder, and somehow he understood:
      Not everything needs speed. "But I don't know how to be slow," Micah whispered.
      The moth's wings pulsed gently, like a quiet heartbeat. Micah took one careful
      breath. "Okay. I'll try."
