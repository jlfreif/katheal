      A vast landscape of floating platforms and obstacles in Kathaél, perfect for parkour. Micah
      runs and jumps and vaults from platform to platform, chasing the golden speed creature that
      stays just ahead of him. His movements are impressive—flips, rolls, perfect landings—but
      he's breathing hard, sweat on his face. The creature darts ahead effortlessly. Other creatures
      watch from the sidelines, calling advice he doesn't hear. His expression shows determined
      effort but growing frustration. The atmosphere is all motion, no pause, exhausting to even
      watch.

      Micah landed in Kathaél and immediately started chasing the golden creature across floating platforms. Jumping and climbing and never stopping. He was fast. Strong. But the creature stayed ahead, moving like it wasn't even trying. Micah pushed harder. His lungs burned. He wouldn't stop. Couldn't stop.

    visual: |
      Micah collapses on a platform, gasping for breath, completely exhausted. The golden creature
      hovers nearby, not even winded, waiting patiently. A wise old crane appears, moving with
      deliberate slowness and grace, landing gently on Micah's platform. The crane breathes
      slowly, centered and calm. Micah sprawled out, chest heaving, frustrated. The contrast
      between Micah's chaos and the crane's calm is stark. The atmosphere shifts from frantic
      motion to forced stillness through exhaustion.

      Micah collapsed, gasping. The creature waited, patient and calm. A crane landed beside him. "You'll never catch speed by chasing it," the crane said. "Speed comes from pause, from breath, from knowing when to be still." Micah was too exhausted to argue.
