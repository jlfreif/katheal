      The base of the golden tower in Kathaél, with a winding staircase spiraling up the outside.
      Micah starts climbing enthusiastically, hand over hand, feet finding each step. Ten feet up.
      Fifteen feet. Twenty. Then he makes the mistake of looking down. The ground suddenly seems
      so far away. His hands freeze on the railing. His breath catches. The tower stretches
      endlessly above but he can't move—stuck, pressed against the wall, terrified of the drop
      below. Other creatures climb past him easily. His expression shows frozen fear overriding
      determination. The atmosphere is the moment when fear wins.

      Micah grabbed the golden tower's railing and started climbing. He could do this. Ten feet. Fifteen. Twenty. Then he looked down. The ground was so far away. His hands locked. His breath stopped. Too high. Way too high. He pressed against the wall, stuck. Above, the tower stretched forever. Below, nothing but space. He couldn't move.

      A magnificent golden eagle lands beside Micah on the tower, perched gracefully despite the
      height that terrifies him. The eagle looks out at the view—at vast Kathaél spread below,
      at distant mountains and forests—with calm confidence. Heights are the eagle's home. Micah
      clings to the railing, not daring to look. The eagle's feathers shimmer with golden light,
      and one drifts free, floating gently down. "Heights aren't the enemy," the eagle says.
      "Fear is. Courage isn't not being afraid. It's climbing anyway." Micah's expression shows
      desperate hope mixed with doubt. The atmosphere shifts from paralysis to possibility.

      A golden eagle landed beside him, unbothered by the height. "You looked down," it said. "That's where the fear lives. Keep your eyes on where you're going, not where you might fall." Micah's voice shook. "But what if I do fall?" The eagle's feathers glowed. "Courage isn't not being scared. It's climbing anyway. One hand. One foot. Eyes forward."
