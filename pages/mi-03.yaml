      A vast landscape of floating platforms in Kathaél, connected by ropes and beams—perfect for
      parkour. Micah runs and jumps and vaults from platform to platform with impressive skill.
      Sprint. Jump. Swing across rope. Vault the beam. Land. Roll. His movements are coordinated
      and powerful, his expression focused and confident. The platforms glow faintly as he crosses
      them. He's in his element, using his parkour expertise. The atmosphere shows athletic mastery
      and physical joy.

      Micah approached the first platform course like any other obstacle. Sprint. Jump. Swing across the rope. Vault the beam. Land. Roll. He was fast, coordinated, powerful. The platforms glowed faintly as he crossed them. "See? Easy!" he called back. This was what he was built for.

      Chaos as platforms suddenly start moving—rotating, shifting, dropping. One drops out from
      under Micah mid-jump and he barely catches the edge, pulling himself up with effort. Another
      platform shoots upward just as he lands, launching him into the air. He crashes into a tree
      branch, surprised and frustrated. The platforms he'd lit up go dark again, resetting to their
      broken state. A silver fox sits on a nearby branch, watching with patient, knowing eyes. Micah
      looks frustrated but determined—this is harder than expected. The atmosphere shifts from
      confidence to challenge.

      Then the platforms started moving. Rotating. Shifting. One dropped out from under him mid-jump. He barely caught the edge, pulled himself up. Another platform shot upward just as he landed, launching him into the air. He crashed into a tree branch. "Okay, NOT easy!" The platforms he'd lit went dark again, resetting. A silver fox sat on a nearby branch, watching with patient eyes. This was going to be harder than it looked.
