      A vast chamber in the Library with floating platforms connected by mechanical gears, levers,
      and pulleys. Perfect for parkour. Micah runs and jumps and vaults from platform to platform
      with impressive skill. Sprint. Jump. Pull a lever. Vault the beam. Land. Roll. His movements
      are coordinated and powerful, his expression focused and confident. The mechanisms glow faintly
      as he activates them. He's in his element, using his parkour expertise. Books flutter on nearby
      branches, watching. The atmosphere shows athletic mastery and physical joy. Text in Times New

      Micah followed his golden thread, away from Elise and ran outside, where he saw a mechanical obstacle course. Sprint. Jump. Pull the lever. Vault the gear. Land. Roll. He was fast, coordinated, powerful. The mechanisms glowed faintly as he crossed them. "See? Easy!" he called back. This was what he was built for.

      Chaos as platforms suddenly start moving—rotating, shifting, dropping. One mechanism drops out
      from under Micah mid-jump and he barely catches the edge, pulling himself up with effort. Another
      platform shoots upward just as he lands, launching him into the air. He crashes into a tree
      branch, surprised and frustrated. The mechanisms he'd activated go dark again, resetting to their
      broken state. A silver fox sits on a nearby floating scroll, watching with patient, knowing eyes.
      Micah looks frustrated but determined—this is harder than expected. The atmosphere shifts from
      confidence to challenge. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Then the mechanisms started moving. Rotating. Shifting. One dropped out from under him mid-jump. He barely caught the edge, pulled himself up. Another gear shot upward just as he landed, launching him into the air. He crashed into a branch. "Okay, NOT easy!" The mechanisms he'd activated went dark again, resetting. A silver fox sat on a nearby scroll, watching with patient eyes. This was going to be harder than it looked.
