    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Micah sprints through a clearing in Kathaél, arms outstretched trying to catch golden
      threads that float in the air. His body is a blur of motion, captured mid-leap as he
      jumps to reach a high thread. Threads scatter away from him like startled birds, their
      light flickering nervously. His expression shows intense focus and determination. The
      forest around him seems to pull back from his frantic energy. Leaves swirl in the wake
      of his movement. A tangle of threads hovers just out of reach, pulling tighter.

      Micah saw the tangled threads and knew exactly what to do: catch them, untangle them,
      fix them. Fast. He darted through the clearing, hands grabbing for the glowing strands.
      But they slipped away before he could catch them. He ran faster, jumped higher. The
      threads scattered like frightened fish, tangling worse with each frantic grab.

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work

    visual: |
      Micah stands panting in the center of the clearing, hands on his knees, catching his
      breath. Around him, threads hang in worse tangles than before, their light dimmer and
      more agitated. Some have knotted together into tight clumps. His face shows frustration
      and confusion, sweat on his brow. A wise old owl perches on a nearby branch, watching
      him with knowing eyes. The forest is perfectly still except for Micah's heavy breathing.
      A single calm thread hovers far away, as if keeping its distance.

      Micah stopped, breathing hard. The threads were worse now. Tighter. Darker. He'd made
      things worse by trying to help. An owl blinked at him from a branch. "Speed isn't always
      strength," it said quietly. Micah wanted to argue, to run again, to do something. But
      the owl just watched, patient and still. Maybe fast wasn't the answer. But what else did he know how to do?
