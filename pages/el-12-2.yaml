      Evening light fills Elise's room. She's created a small dance in front of her mirror—the
      silly, joyful kind she always did, but now she's singing along, giving voice to the movement.
      Her paperbird dances with her, trailing colors through the air. On her walls, new art appears:
      sketches with stories written beside them, observations turned into poems, details transformed
      into truths. She's learned to pair her visual voice with her spoken one. Her gentle nature
      hasn't changed—she's just added courage to it.

      Elise danced and sang, letting her body and voice move together freely. The paperbird joined
      her, painting the air with joy-colors. She was still quiet, still gentle—but now she knew
      that didn't mean silent. She had so much to say.

      Elise sits curled up in her window seat at twilight, her paperbird nestled against her
      (she loves to cuddle). Through the window, stars are appearing, and the Whispering Woods
      glow faintly with magic. She's writing in her starlight journal, documenting her journey,
      ready to share it with anyone who needs to hear that quiet voices matter. On her nightstand:
      Noah's planted acorn already showing a silver sprout, her art supplies, the feather charm
      she made. She looks peaceful, whole, transformed. The woods whisper approval, and somewhere,
      a new paperbird is born from her written words.

      Elise wrote by starlight, her paperbird glowing softly beside her: "Dear quiet observer,
      your voice matters. Your gentle noticing changes the world. Speak what you see, even when
      it's scary. Especially when it's scary. You are enough." The woods hummed in agreement.
