      Noah sits at a wooden desk in his cozy bedroom, surrounded by open books, scattered papers
      with half-written stories, and a ukulele leaning against the wall. His sandy blond hair
      catches afternoon light streaming through a round window. His expression shows frustration—
      brow furrowed, pencil tapping against his lips. Three different notebooks lie open before
      him, each started but abandoned. A blog post glows on his laptop screen: "The Problem with
      Too Many Paths." Outside the window, the Whispering Woods shimmer with golden light.

      Noah stared at three different story beginnings, unable to choose which one to finish.
      "Why can't someone just tell me which is the right one?" he muttered, setting down his pencil.

      Noah stands at his window, hands pressed against the glass. Through the round window,
      the Whispering Woods glow with unusual golden light, and a small glint—like metal catching
      sun—sparkles near the forest edge. His expression shifts from frustration to curiosity,
      eyes widening slightly. The room behind him is bathed in warm afternoon glow. A paperbird
      made of folded parchment sits on his windowsill, its wings shimmering faintly.

      Something golden flashed at the edge of the woods—sharp and bright, like a signal meant just for him.
      Noah pressed closer to the window. Adventure whispered his name.
