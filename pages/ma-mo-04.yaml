      A peaceful glen with soft emerald grass and small glowing flowers dotting the edges. A
      magnificent golden owl sits on a low branch, its large amber eyes wise and kind. Maya
      stands looking up at the owl, hands on her hips, her expression earnest and hopeful.
      Beside her, Mona (2 years old, wavy short dark brown hair, wearing light blue overalls
      with brooklyn shirt and white sneakers) toddles forward, pointing up at the owl with
      one chubby hand, her face lit with delight. Soft golden light filters through the trees.
      The owl's feathers seem to shimmer slightly. The atmosphere is gentle and safe, like a
      protected pocket of the forest.

      Maya found the owl in a quiet glen, its golden feathers shimmering in dappled light.
      "Can you help us?" she asked. "The colors are fading everywhere." A sound made her turn.
      A tiny girl, barely past babyhood, toddled into the glen, face bright with wonder. "Up!
      Bird!" Mona squealed, pointing at the owl with pure joy.

    focus: Receiving direction with warning
    visual: |
      The owl spreads its wings wide, golden feathers catching the light, as it gestures with
      one wing toward the darker forest beyond the glen. Maya crouches beside Mona, one arm
      gently around the toddler's shoulders, both looking in the direction the owl indicates.
      Through the trees ahead, the forest grows wilder and less tame, with tangled vines and
      deeper shadows. Mona's expression is curious rather than afraid, her head tilted as she
      listens. Maya's face shows determination mixed with protectiveness. The safe glen suddenly
      feels small compared to the vast forest ahead.

      The owl's eyes grew serious. "The answer waits where the forest grows wild," it said,
      spreading its wings toward the tangled woods beyond the glen. "But be careful, little
      ones. Wild places need different courage." Mona grabbed Maya's hand, squeezing tight.
      Maya squeezed back, looking at the tiny girl beside her, then at the path ahead. They'd
      go together.
