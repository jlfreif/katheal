    visual: |
      A magical artist's studio built in the branches of an ancient tree, sunlight
      streaming through large windows. Canvases line the walls, but their paintings
      are fading like watercolors left in rain. Maya (9 years old, sandy-blond hair
      with pink streak, bold and athletic) stands at an easel, brush in hand, watching
      in frustration as the blue she just applied drains to gray. Paint supplies scatter
      the wooden floor. Through the window, golden threads drift past, their light
      flickering weakly.

      Maya dragged her brush across the canvas. Brilliant blue bloomed for just a second,
      then faded to nothing. "Come on," she muttered, trying again. Same thing. Every
      color she tried turned gray within heartbeats. The studio that usually burst with
      life felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for something.

    focus: Receiving direction through fearless creativity

    visual: |
      Little Mona (2 years old, dark curly hair, bright curious eyes) sits on a stool
      beside Maya, painting with fearless abandon. Where Mona's brush touches the canvas,
      colors STAY - vivid reds, brilliant yellows, deep purples. Maya leans in, amazed,
      watching this tiny artist create with complete confidence. Mona grins, tilting her
      head as she adds another bold stroke. The golden threads outside pulse brighter,
      responding to Mona's courage. Maya's canvas begins to hold color where she paints
      without fear.

      A small voice piped up. "Paint with me!" Mona stood at the next easel, her brush
      already moving. Where she painted, colors blazed and held. Maya stared. "How are
      you doing that?" Mona giggled, adding a sunburst of yellow. "Just be you!" Maya
      took a breath, pushed away her worries, and painted. This time, the color stayed.
