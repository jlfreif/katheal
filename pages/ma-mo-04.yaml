    visual: |
      A peaceful glen with soft emerald grass and small glowing flowers dotting the edges. A
      magnificent golden owl sits on a low branch, its large amber eyes wise and kind. Maya
      stands looking up at the owl, hands on her hips, her expression earnest and hopeful.
      Beside her, Mona (2 years old, Caucasian with fair skin, wavy short dark brown ringlets,
      wearing light blue overalls with brooklyn shirt and white sneakers) toddles forward, pointing up at the owl with
      one chubby hand, her face lit with delight. Soft golden light filters through the trees.
      The owl's feathers seem to shimmer slightly. The atmosphere is gentle and safe, like a
      protected pocket of the forest.

      Maya found a golden owl. "Can you help us? The colors are fading." A tiny figure toddled in. Maya's eyes went wide. "Mona? You're here too?" The toddler squealed, pointing up. "Up! Bird!"

    focus: Receiving direction with warning
    visual: |
      The owl spreads its wings wide, golden feathers catching the light, as it gestures with
      one wing toward the darker forest beyond the glen. Maya crouches beside Mona, one arm
      gently around the toddler's shoulders, both looking in the direction the owl indicates.
      Through the trees ahead, the forest grows wilder and less tame, with tangled vines and
      deeper shadows. Mona's expression is curious rather than afraid, her head tilted as she
      listens. Maya's face shows determination mixed with protectiveness. The safe glen suddenly
      feels small compared to the vast forest ahead.

      "The answer waits where the forest grows wild," the owl said. "But be careful. Some truths hide deep beneath the surface. And sometimes you must act before knowing why." Maya understood—she'd need to see beyond appearances. Mona clutched her bunny and Maya's hand. "Why wild?" she asked. "Because wild things grow true," the owl said. "Not controlled. Not performing. Just... themselves." Both girls felt the words settle into their hearts. Somewhere ahead, color waited to be discovered and courage waited to be planted.
