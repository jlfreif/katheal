      Noah stands at the threshold between sunny meadow and shadowy forest. One foot forward,
      one foot back, body angled in hesitation. He holds the compass in both hands like a
      precious artifact, studying its swirling golden needle. The Whispering Woods loom before
      him—tall ancient trees with gnarled roots, mysterious shadows, faint trails of mist
      curling between trunks. Butterflies dance in the meadow behind him. His expression shows
      determination mixed with anxiety.

      Noah took a deep breath. Every sensible bone in his body said "go home."
      But the compass pulsed warm in his hands, and curiosity won. He stepped forward.

      Noah walks deeper into the woods, surrounded by towering trees whose canopy filters
      sunlight into soft green-gold beams. The path is barely visible—more suggestion than
      trail. Strange, beautiful things appear: glowing mushrooms, paperbirds flitting between
      branches (their wings shifting from cream to pale blue), and trees with bark that seems
      to shimmer with ancient writing. Noah looks around with wide eyes, simultaneously
      frightened and amazed. The compass needle points steadily forward.

      The woods weren't scary—they were alive with wonder. Paperbirds sang in crystalline
      voices, and the trees whispered secrets Noah couldn't quite understand yet. He kept walking.
