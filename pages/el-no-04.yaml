      A forest crossroads where four paths meet beneath an enormous ancient oak. Golden threads
      weave through the air between branches. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair,
      medium build, blue hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) stands on one path, studying the
      threads. Elise appears on another path. They face each other across the crossroads in surprise.
      Morning mist swirls. Luminescent mushrooms dot the moss. The threads pulse gently. Text in

      The owl led Noah from the library to a crossroads. Golden threads floated between oak branches. Each pointed a different direction. Footsteps. Noah looked up. "Elise?" His cousin stood on another path. "What are YOU doing here?" Her eyes went wide. "Noah! I can't believe it's you!"

    focus: Receiving direction with warning
    visual: |
      Noah and Elise both reach toward where the golden threads converge above them. The threads
      weave together, forming an arrow pointing deeper into the dark forest. They look at each other
      with determination. The threads' golden light illuminates their faces. Small light particles
      drift like fireflies. The path ahead disappears into mysterious shadows. They stand apart, not
      touching, but unified in purpose. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      They reached toward the threads together. The threads wove into an arrow pointing deep into the dark forest. "They want us to follow them," Elise whispered. "Together." Noah nodded, already planning the route in his head. But the threads shimmered and shifted, impossible to predict. "I can't map this," he admitted. "Good," Elise said softly. "Maybe we're not supposed to control it. Just... trust it?" The threads pulsed brighter and drifted forward, leading them toward where the Heart Crystal's power waited.
