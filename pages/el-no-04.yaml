    visual: |
      A crossroads in the forest where four distinct paths meet beneath an enormous ancient oak
      tree. Golden threads flow through the air like streams of light, weaving between the oak's
      branches. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue hoodie
      and tan sport pants) stands on the left path, hand extended toward a cluster of threads,
      his expression focused and analytical. Elise approaches from the right path, her posture
      graceful, watching the same threads with wonder. The threads pulse gently, as if alive.
      Morning mist swirls around their feet. Small luminescent mushrooms dot the moss beneath
      the oak. The atmosphere feels hushed and important.

      The owl led Noah to a crossroads beneath an ancient oak. He studied the golden threads floating between the branches, trying to decode their pattern. Each one seemed to point a different direction. Footsteps made him look up. Elise appeared on another path, moving with a dancer's grace. "The threads are showing us something," he said aloud. "A pattern, maybe?"

      Noah and Elise stand closer now, both reaching toward where the golden threads converge
      into a bright, pulsing point of light above them. The threads weave together, forming
      an arrow-like pattern pointing deeper into the forest where the trees grow darker and
      closer together. Both children look at each other, Noah's expression uncertain but
      determined, Elise's showing quiet courage. The threads' golden light illuminates their
      faces. Small particles of light drift around them like fireflies. The path ahead looks
      both inviting and challenging, disappearing into mysterious shadows.

      Elise reached up beside him, and the threads responded. They wove together into an arrow pointing deep into the dark forest. "They want us to follow them," Elise whispered. "Together." Noah nodded slowly, swallowing his nervousness. The threads pulsed once more, then began drifting forward, leading them into unknown territory.
