      A forest crossroads where four paths meet beneath an enormous ancient oak. Golden threads
      weave through the air between branches. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair,
      medium build, blue hoodie, tan sport pants, white sneakers) arrives on one path, following
      the owl from the library. Elise appears on another path. They face each other across the
      crossroads in surprise. The owl perches above. Morning mist swirls. The threads pulse gently.

      The owl led Noah from the library to a crossroads. Golden threads floated between oak branches. Footsteps. Noah looked up. "Elise?" His sister stood on another path. "What are YOU doing here?" Her eyes went wide. "Noah! I can't believe it's you!"

      The owl spreads its wings. Noah and Elise listen as it explains. The golden threads behind it
      weave together, pointing deeper into the dark forest where harder challenges wait. Small light
      particles drift like fireflies. The path ahead disappears into mysterious shadows. Noah and
      Elise exchange determined looks. They're family. They'll face this together. But soon the
      paths will split again.

      "The paths ahead grow harder," the owl said. "The challenges require more. You'll need all the courage you've been learning." Noah grinned. "We can handle it. Right, Elise?" She nodded. The threads pulsed brighter and drifted forward into the dark forest. They followed together. But soon, the paths would split, and each would face their own challenges alone.
