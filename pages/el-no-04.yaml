    visual: |
      A crossroads in the forest where four distinct paths meet beneath an enormous ancient oak
      tree. Golden threads flow through the air like streams of light, weaving between the oak's
      branches. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, wearing blue hoodie
      and tan sport pants) stands on the left path, hand extended toward a cluster of threads,
      his expression focused and analytical. Elise approaches from the right path, her posture
      graceful, watching the same threads with wonder. The threads pulse gently, as if alive.
      Morning mist swirls around their feet. Small luminescent mushrooms dot the moss beneath
      the oak. The atmosphere feels hushed and important.

      The rabbit led Elise to a crossroads beneath an ancient oak. Noah studied the golden threads floating between the branches like they were a puzzle to solve. Elise watched them like they were a dance to learn. "They're showing us something," he said. "A pattern, maybe?" The threads pulsed gently, waiting.

      Noah and Elise stand closer now, both reaching toward where the golden threads converge
      into a bright, pulsing point of light above them. The threads weave together, forming
      an arrow-like pattern pointing deeper into the forest where the trees grow darker and
      closer together. Both children look at each other, Noah's expression uncertain but
      determined, Elise's showing quiet courage. The threads' golden light illuminates their
      faces. Small particles of light drift around them like fireflies. The path ahead looks
      both inviting and challenging, disappearing into mysterious shadows.

      They reached up together and the threads responded. The threads wove into an arrow pointing deep into the dark forest. "Together," Elise whispered. "They want us to follow." Noah nodded, swallowing his nervousness. The threads led them forward into unknown territory, pulling them along the winding path.
