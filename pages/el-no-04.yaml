    visual: |
      A crossroads in Kathaél where multiple forest paths meet beneath an ancient willow
      whose branches glow with golden threads. Noah stands on the left path, notebook
      tucked under his arm, one hand extended toward a shimmering thread. His expression
      shows frustration mixed with hope. Unfinished story-threads hang frozen nearby.

      Noah's perfect endings hadn't worked. He followed the threads to a crossroads
      beneath an ancient willow, hoping someone here might know what he was missing.
      Golden light wove through the branches. He reached toward one thread, and it
      hummed warmly—but the path it suggested led deeper into unfamiliar territory.

    visual: |
      Elise stands on the right path, head tilted as she observes a different glowing
      thread, her watercolor set hanging from her wrist. Between the two children,
      threads weave and intersect in midair, creating a soft lattice of golden light.
      Both are shown in profile, aware of each other's presence.

      Elise noticed the boy at the same moment he noticed her. They didn't speak,
      but she saw him reaching for the threads just like she was—someone else who
      didn't have all the answers. Something about not being alone made the path
      ahead feel less frightening. The threads pulsed brighter, as if pleased.
