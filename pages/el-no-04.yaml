      A crossroads beneath an ancient willow where forest paths meet. Golden threads
      flow through the branches, some frayed and flickering. Noah stands on the left
      path, notebook tucked under his arm, reaching toward a thread. In the distance,
      the Heart Crystal pulses weakly, more threads drifting loose.

      "I've tried everything." Noah followed the threads to a crossroads beneath
      an ancient willow, hoping someone here might know what he was missing. The
      Crystal glowed through the trees, dimmer than before, more threads
      unraveling. He reached toward one, and it hummed warmly. But the path it
      suggested led deeper into unfamiliar territory.

    visual: |
      Elise moves along the right path with flowing, dance-like steps, her arms
      extended gracefully toward a different thread. Between the children, threads
      flow and intersect, creating a lattice of golden light. Both turn toward each
      other, curious. The willow's branches glow brighter where their paths nearly touch.

      Noah spotted her at the same moment she spotted him. A girl moving through the
      light with graceful, flowing gestures, reaching for the threads just like he was.
      "Are you trying to help them too?" he called. She nodded, arms still extended.
      "They keep rejecting everything I try." "Same." Something warm spread through his
      chest. He wasn't alone in this. The threads between them pulsed brighter and felt
      warm, like sunshine on skin.
