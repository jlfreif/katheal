    visual: |
      A crossroads in Kathaél where multiple forest paths meet beneath an ancient willow
      whose branches glow with golden threads. Noah stands on the left path, one hand
      extended toward a shimmering thread at eye level, expression focused and curious.
      Morning mist rolls through the background forest. Luminescent mushrooms dot the
      mossy ground.

      Noah followed the threads to a crossroads beneath an ancient willow. Golden
      light wove through its branches like a living tapestry. He reached toward one
      thread, hoping it might show him where to go. The thread hummed warmly under
      his fingers, but the path it suggested led into darkness.

      Elise stands on the right path, head tilted as she observes a different glowing
      thread, her hand raised gently. Between the two children, threads weave and
      intersect in midair, creating a soft lattice of golden light. Both are shown
      in profile, aware of each other's presence. Small particles of light drift
      like fireflies.

      Elise noticed the boy at the same moment he noticed her. They didn't speak,
      but she saw him reaching for the threads just like she was. Something about
      not being alone made the path ahead feel less frightening. The threads pulsed
      brighter, as if pleased that two hearts were listening.
