      A forest crossroads where six rhythm-paths meet beneath an enormous ancient oak. Each path
      shows increasingly complex footprint patterns—some with spins, some with leaps, some with
      intricate sequences. Golden threads weave through the air between branches, pulsing with
      directional light. Elise stands at the center, studying the patterns, breathing hard from
      her journey. Noah (12 years old, sandy blond voluminous hair, medium build, blue hoodie,
      tan sport pants, white sneakers) arrives on another path, surprised to see her. The Heart
      Crystal is visible in the distance, still cracked and dimming. The paths ahead look
      dangerous and difficult. Morning mist swirls around their feet.

      The golden threads led Elise to a crossroads. Six paths met beneath an ancient oak. Each showed footprints more complex than the last. Spins. Leaps. Sequences she'd never tried. Footsteps. "Noah?" Her cousin stood on another path. "Elise? What are YOU doing here?" They stared at each other. "You're in Kathaél too?"

    focus: Receiving direction with warning
    visual: |
      The golden threads converge above Noah and Elise, weaving together to illuminate one specific
      path forward. This path winds into the dark forest, its footprint patterns visible but
      incredibly complex—showing combinations of spins, leaps, and rapid sequences. The path
      glows brighter than the others, clearly marking the way they must go. But it also shows
      warning signs: cracks in the path, gaps that will require perfect timing, sections that
      pulse with dangerous energy. Both children study it with determination mixed with concern.
      The threads' golden light illuminates their faces. The path ahead looks genuinely difficult
      and dangerous.

      The golden threads wove together, lighting one path forward. It wound deep into the forest. The footprints showed moves Elise had never tried—spins mid-leap, rapid combinations, sequences that would take everything she had. "The threads are showing us the way," Noah said, studying the pattern. "But those paths look dangerous." Elise nodded. "We'll figure it out as we go." The threads pulsed brighter. The path ahead waited. Soon, the paths would split, and Elise would have to continue alone.
