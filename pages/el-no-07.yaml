      The edge of a misty ravine where a broken bridge of starlight stretches partway
      across before fading to nothing. Noah kneels on the left side, both hands pressed
      against the translucent surface, looking at where it ends abruptly in midair.
      His brow furrows with frustration and exhaustion. The ravine below is deep
      and filled with swirling blue-grey mist.

      The bridge stretched partway across the ravine and then just stopped, dissolving
      into mist. Noah pressed his hands against the cool, glowing surface, willing
      it to continue. His arms ached. His hope was wearing thin. On the far side,
      his path waited, impossibly far away.

    visual: |
      Elise sits on the right side of the same bridge segment, legs dangling over
      the edge, head bowed, arms wrapped around herself. Between them, faint golden
      threads pulse weakly. The sky above is twilight. Small moths with luminescent
      wings circle around them. Both children are tired but still present.

      Elise sat with her legs dangling over the edge, too tired to move. Then she
      looked up and saw the boy from the crossroads, still trying. His hands
      pressed against the bridge like he believed it could work. Something sparked
      in her chest. If he was still trying, maybe she could too. Neither felt
      quite so alone.
