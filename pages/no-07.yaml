      The forest library. Golden story-threads float between tree branches like ribbons forming words.
      Noah stands on a natural platform of roots, hands reaching toward a nearly-complete story. The
      words glow: "And then she discovered..." Ending just out of reach. So close. Other completed
      stories hang on branches around him, their threads solid and glowing. A candle burns on a tree
      stump, flame bright and steady. His face shows hope. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white
      space at bottom.

      Noah reached for the ending. Word by word it formed. Almost there. The perfect conclusion. The story pulsed. Nearly complete. Around him, finished stories hung whole. Proof it could be done. The candle burned steady. Bright. Just a little more.

      The story-thread slips through Noah's fingers. The ending shifts. Changes. Becomes something
      different than he planned. He stands with arms out, face showing frustration as words rearrange
      themselves. The candle flame flickers wildly but doesn't die. The story ends its own way. Its
      threads weave a pattern he didn't predict. Through the trees, a door glows faintly. He hadn't
      seen it before. His expression shifts from control to acceptance. Text in Times New Roman 16pt
      in white space at bottom.

      The ending shifted. Changed. Became something he hadn't planned. Noah tried to guide it back. The story had its own ideas. The candle flickered. Stayed lit. "I'm not in control," he whispered. "The story is. Maybe that's okay." Through the trees, a glowing door. That's where he needed to go.
