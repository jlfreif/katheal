    focus: Fighting to protect the stories
    visual: |
      Shadow-creatures pour into the forest library. Writhing darkness with claws of smoke. They rip
      at the golden story-threads. Tearing. Destroying. Noah leaps between the trees, his golden quill
      blazing like a sword. He slashes at the shadows. They screech and dissolve. But more keep coming.
      Stories fall from branches. Noah catches them. Dodges shadow-claws. Writes protective words in
      the air that flash and burn the darkness. Sweat on his face. Determination. A candle burns on a
      tree stump, its flame flickering as shadows rush past. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white

      Shadow-creatures attacked. Ripping at the stories. Tearing threads. Noah's quill blazed like a sword. He slashed. Shadows screeched. Dissolved. More came. He leaped between trees. Caught falling stories. Dodged claws of smoke. Wrote burning words that drove them back. But there were so many.

    visual: |
      Noah stands surrounded by shadows. They circle him. Too many to fight. He raises his quill to
      write another protection spell. But his hand shakes. Exhausted. A shadow lunges. Noah writes
      frantically. The words scatter. Wrong. The shadow passes through. Touches a story-thread. It
      starts to grey. Noah grabs for it but the thread changes on its own. Writes its own ending.
      Different than he planned. But it works. The shadow dissolves. The candle flame steadies. Noah
      stares. "I can't control everything," he breathes. Through the trees, a glowing door appears.

      Too many shadows. Noah's quill blazed. Slashed. Wrote. But he was one person. Exhausted. A shadow lunged. He wrote frantically. Wrong words. The shadow touched a thread. It started to grey. But then the thread changed. Wrote its own ending. The shadow dissolved. "I can't protect everything," Noah breathed. "And maybe I don't have to."
