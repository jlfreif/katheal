      Noah moves through the forest library with a light touch. He loosens chains but doesn't
      direct the stories. Offers support but doesn't control outcomes. Stories bloom around him—
      each finding their own way, each different from what he would have planned, each beautiful.
      Golden threads weave freely. Other creatures celebrate. He's learning to let go. His face
      shows cautious pride mixed with ongoing discomfort. The atmosphere is progress in releasing
      control. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah loosened chains. Let stories breathe. Didn't tell them where to go. Just... released them. They found their own paths. Weird paths. Unexpected paths. Better paths. The library blazed with life. He was doing it. Learning to let go.

      The Heart Crystal story appears—the most important one, the one that could save everything.
      Noah watches it carefully, hands off, letting it unfold. But then it takes a turn that
      terrifies him. The main character chooses danger over safety. The plot goes somewhere dark.
      Everything in Noah screams that this is wrong. His hands reach out instinctively to grab it,
      control it, force it back to the "right" path. He's trembling. This matters too much to let
      go. What if he releases control and it all falls apart? His expression shows pure fear. The
      atmosphere is the moment when trust is hardest. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space

      The Heart Crystal's story unfolded. Noah watched. Hands off. Letting it choose. Then it went somewhere dark. Dangerous. Wrong. His hands shot out. "No! Not that way! It'll break everything!" His fingers touched the golden threads. One pull and he could control it. Fix it. Make it safe. But... that was the old way. His hands shook. What if letting go meant losing everything?
