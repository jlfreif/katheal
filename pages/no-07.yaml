      The library chamber alive with activity. Noah coordinates from the center, calling out connections
      between the pedestals. His teammates work at different pedestals (shown but not individually focused).
      Golden threads glow brighter as patterns align. The constellation pedestal rotates. The word riddle
      pedestal pulses. The math sequences cascade. Musical notes chime in harmony. The mechanisms click into
      rhythm. Noah's face shows intense focus as he tracks everything at once. Books float excitedly around
      them. The Heart Crystal glows warmer. Progress! The atmosphere is exciting coordination. Text in Times

      "Bear constellation now!" Noah shouted. Click. "That triggers the word 'North'—call it out!" "North!" someone yelled. "Which means math sequence three!" Another voice. Numbers cascaded. Musical notes chimed. Gears spun. They were doing it! Working together. The patterns aligning. The Heart Crystal glowed warmer. Almost there!

      All five pedestals suddenly pulse with urgent red light. A countdown appears above the Heart Crystal—
      glowing numbers ticking down. The owl swoops down urgently. "The final sequence!" it calls. "All five
      patterns must complete simultaneously in perfect rhythm!" Noah stares at the countdown, then at the five
      pedestals spread around the chamber. They've solved the patterns but never all at exactly the same time.
      His expression shows realization of the ultimate challenge. His teammates look to him for the plan. The
      atmosphere shifts to urgent preparation. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      All five pedestals flared red. A countdown blazed above the Heart Crystal. "The final sequence!" the owl cried. "All five patterns must complete together. Perfect timing. Perfect rhythm." Noah's eyes went wide. They'd solved each pattern. But all at once? In perfect sync? He looked at his team scattered around the chamber. "We need a plan," he said. "And we need it now."
