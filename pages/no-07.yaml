      Noah stands before a golden story-thread that is slowly writing itself,
      words forming in soft light. His hands hover nearby, fingers twitching
      with the urge to help. A lantern rests on a stone beside him, its flame
      burning steady. Several completed threads glow behind him, proof his
      new approach works.

      The story was writing itself, just like he'd learned. Words appeared
      one by one: "The traveler found the path and—" Noah watched, hands
      hovering, the lantern beside him burning steady. It was working. He
      just had to wait. Just had to trust.

      Noah's hand has reached toward the thread, pen appearing in his grip.
      The story-thread has frozen mid-word, rejecting his interference. The
      lantern flame sputters and dims. His expression shows frustration with
      himself. He couldn't help it—he had to try to make the ending better.

      But the ending wasn't coming fast enough. Noah's hand shot out before
      he could stop himself, pen appearing: "—and found exactly what he needed."
      The thread froze. The lantern flickered and dimmed. He'd done it again.
      He couldn't stop trying to control everything, even when he knew better.
