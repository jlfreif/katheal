      Noah stands before a golden thread slowly writing itself, words forming
      in soft light. His hands hover nearby, fingers twitching. A lantern burns
      steady on a stone beside him. Behind him, several completed threads glow,
      proof his new approach works when he lets it.

      "The traveler found the path and..." Words appeared one by one, the story
      writing itself. Noah's hands hovered, itching to help. "Come on, come on."
      The lantern beside him burned steady, as if saying: trust this. He
      wondered if the girl at the crossroads was figuring things out too.
      He hoped she wasn't alone.

      Noah's hand has reached toward the thread, pen in his grip. The story-thread
      freezes mid-word, rejecting his interference. The lantern flame sputters
      and dims. His expression shows frustration with himself. The glow around
      the thread fades dangerously.

      But the ending was taking too long. Before he could stop himself, Noah's
      hand shot out: "...and found exactly what he needed." The thread froze.
      The lantern flickered and dimmed. "No! Why do I keep doing this?" He
      knew better. He knew presence mattered more than perfection. But
      trusting felt so much harder than controlling.
