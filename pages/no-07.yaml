      A magnificent guardian made of swirling golden threads and puzzle pieces blocks the path to the Heart
      Crystal's chamber. It constantly shifts—constellation stars becoming word tiles becoming numbers becoming
      musical notes becoming gears. The guardian attacks by launching puzzle sequences at Noah that he must
      solve mid-battle. A math equation flies at him. He shouts the answer and it dissolves. Word tiles spiral
      toward him. "Navigate!" he calls, solving the riddle. They vanish. The guardian shifts faster, combining
      patterns. Noah dodges, thinks, shouts solutions rapid-fire. His expression shows intense focus and
      excitement—this is his kind of battle. Like speed-chess with a living puzzle. The atmosphere is
      high-energy mental combat, thrilling and challenging.

      But before Noah could leave to find his teammates, a guardian made of threads and puzzles appeared, launching riddles and other problems at Noah. It launched a math sequence at Noah. "Forty-two!" he shouted. The numbers dissolved. Word tiles spiraled at him. The guardian moved faster, combining patterns. Noah's mind raced, solving, dodging, calling answers. This was the most intense puzzle battle of his life.

    visual: |
      Noah solves the final combined pattern and the guardian dissolves into peaceful light that flows into
      the five pedestals. He's breathing hard, mentally exhausted but triumphant. The chamber opens fully,
      revealing all five pedestals arranged in a circle around the Heart Crystal. Noah steps forward and they
      activate—all five at once, demanding simultaneous coordination. He attempts to orchestrate them, calling
      out the sequence, tracking all five patterns. He gets three synchronized, then four, but the fifth falls
      out of rhythm. Everything resets with a discordant crash. Noah's expression shifts from confidence to
      dismay. He's already mentally drained from the guardian. The challenge is more complex than he imagined.

      Noah shouted the final answer and the guardian dissolved into light. He bent over, breathing hard, mind spinning from the rapid-fire puzzles. The pedestals were slightly damaged. He tried to coordinate all five. Three aligned. Four. The fifth slipped. Everything crashed. "No!" Noah shouted as he left feeling exhausted.
