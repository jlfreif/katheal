      Noah stands before a golden thread slowly writing itself, words forming in soft
      light. His hands hover nearby, fingers twitching with the urge to help. He grips
      his own wrist with his other hand to hold himself back. A lantern burns steady
      on a stone beside him. Behind him, several completed threads glow, proof his
      new approach works when he lets it.

      "The traveler found the path and..." Words appeared one by one, the story
      writing itself. Noah's hands hovered, fingers twitching. His pen hand kept
      creeping forward like it had a mind of its own. "Come on," he muttered,
      gripping his wrist with his other hand to hold it back. "Let it finish."
      The lantern beside him burned steady. He wondered if the girl at the crossroads
      was figuring things out too.

    visual: |
      Noah's hand has shot forward, pen gripping the thread despite his efforts.
      The story-thread freezes mid-word, rejecting his interference. The lantern
      flame sputters and dims. His expression shows frustration with himself as
      he steps back, running his free hand through his hair. The glow around
      the thread fades dangerously.

      But the pause stretched too long. Noah's hand shot out—he couldn't help it,
      couldn't stop—his pen touched the thread: "...and found exactly what he needed!"
      The thread froze. The glow died. The lantern went dark. "NO!" Noah stepped back,
      running his hand through his hair. He stared at his treacherous fingers. "I was
      so close. Why is waiting so hard?"
