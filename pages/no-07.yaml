    focus: Making real progress
    visual: |
      Noah sprints between barriers, a blur of motion and focus. He solves part of one puzzle, then
      races to another to complete the sequence, then back to a third. Jump, climb, manipulate
      symbols, drop, run, repeat. It's like playing three-dimensional chess while doing parkour.
      His basketball agility and climbing skills are essential—he vaults over fallen pillars, swings
      from branches, scales the mechanisms. Behind him, barriers start to flicker and fade as he
      gets sequences right. Stories begin to pour free, swirling around him in grateful spirals.
      He's doing it! But then he sees it—at the center of the library, a massive lock mechanism
      three times bigger than the others. The master lock. And it's high up in a section where the
      structure is actively collapsing. His expression shows exhilaration mixed with new concern.
      The atmosphere is exciting progress meeting bigger challenge. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in

      Noah raced between locks, solving them in sequence. North wall—rotate Bear to face Hunter. East wall—slide Arrow into position. South wall—activate the pressure sequence. Click-click-click! A barrier dissolved. Stories burst free, swirling gold around him. Another lock. Another. He was doing it! Then he saw the master lock—huge, high up, in a section where stones rained down and branches cracked. The hardest part was still ahead.

    focus: Facing the complication
    visual: |
      Noah stands at the base of the collapsing section, looking up. The master lock is at least
      forty feet up, accessible only by climbing through unstable architecture that's literally
      falling apart. Chunks of stone crash down. A tree branch snaps and falls. The owl appears
      beside him. "That lock controls the Heart Crystal of this library," it says. "Solve it, and
      all the remaining barriers fall. But the climb is dangerous, and you'll need to solve the
      puzzle while hanging on." Noah studies the route—there, that branch, then that ledge, across
      to that beam, up to the lock. It's the kind of climb he's practiced, but never with everything
      falling apart around him. And never while solving the most complex puzzle he's ever faced.
      He takes a breath. His expression shows determination overcoming fear. The atmosphere is
      accepting the hardest challenge yet. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Forty feet up. Crumbling stone. Falling branches. And the most complex lock yet. Noah studied the path. Doable—barely. But solving a seven-system puzzle while hanging on with one hand in the middle of a collapse? His heart pounded. The owl watched him. "Your choice, Noah." He tested his grip, rolled his shoulders. "I've come this far. I'm not stopping now." He jumped for the first handhold.
