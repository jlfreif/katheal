      Noah moves through the library, touching chained stories with glowing hands—but this time he
      doesn't give them answers. He loosens the chains just enough for them to move. "You can try
      now," he whispers. "You can fail. You can make mistakes. It's okay." Stories begin to stir,
      hesitantly taking wrong paths, making mistakes, trying again. A character chooses poorly—Noah's
      hand shoots out instinctively to fix it—he forces himself to pull back. Clenches his fist. Just
      watch. Let them fail. Another story fumbles, struggling—Noah grits his teeth, resisting the
      urge to intervene. It's agony. Every fiber of his being wants to control, to perfect, to guide.
      But he doesn't. And slowly—slowly—stories begin to bloom. Not perfect. Messy. Alive. The chains
      fall away. His expression shows determination fighting instinct. The atmosphere is progress
      through painful restraint. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah touched each chained story, whispering: "You can try now. You can fail." Loosening chains. Not giving answers. Stories stirred, trying things, making mistakes. A character chose wrong—Noah's hand shot out—no. He pulled back. Clenched his fist. Let them fail. Another story fumbled. Every instinct screamed to fix it. He didn't. Just watched. And the story found its own way, messy and imperfect and alive. The chains fell. More stories bloomed. It was working. But it hurt to let go.

    focus: Facing the complication
    visual: |
      At the center of the library, Noah discovers the Heart Crystal—a massive glowing crystal
      surrounded by the thickest chains he's seen. Inside the crystal pulses a story—THE story, the
      one that powers all of Kathaél. It's dying, wrapped so tight in golden perfectionism it can
      barely breathe. Noah approaches, heart pounding. He can feel what the story wants to do—it
      wants to try something radical, something risky, something that might fail spectacularly. The
      chains choke it silent: "MUST SUCCEED" "NO RISKS" "ONLY SAFE CHOICES" "PERFECT OR NOTHING."
      This is the most important story in Kathaél. If it fails—really fails—it could break
      everything. Noah's hands hover over the chains. Every instinct screams to guide it carefully,
      safely, to plot out the perfect path. Can he really let THIS one fail? His expression shows
      terror mixing with determination. The atmosphere is ultimate test of faith. Text in Times New

      The Heart Crystal pulsed at the library's center, wrapped in the thickest chains Noah had seen. Inside—the most important story in Kathaél. Dying. He could feel what it wanted to try—something risky. Something that might fail. Big. The chains strangled it: "MUST SUCCEED" "NO RISKS" "PERFECT OR NOTHING." If this story failed—really failed—it could break everything. Noah's hands touched the chains. This was different. This mattered too much. Could he really let the most important story risk failure? "You have to," the owl said quietly. "All of them. Even this one."
