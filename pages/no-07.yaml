      Noah stands before a golden thread slowly writing itself, words forming
      in soft light. His hands hover nearby, fingers twitching. A lantern burns
      steady on a stone beside him. Behind him, several completed threads glow,
      proof his new approach works when he lets it.

      "The traveler found the path and..." Words appeared one by one, the story
      writing itself. Noah's hands hovered, fingers twitching. His pen hand kept
      creeping forward like it had a mind of its own. "Come on," he muttered, gripping
      his wrist with his other hand to hold it back. "Let it finish." The lantern beside
      him burned steady. He wondered if the girl at the crossroads was figuring things
      out too. He hoped she wasn't alone.

    visual: |
      Noah's hand has reached toward the thread, pen in his grip. The story-thread
      freezes mid-word, rejecting his interference. The lantern flame sputters
      and dims. His expression shows frustration with himself. The glow around
      the thread fades dangerously.

      But the pause stretched too long. Noah's hand shot out—he couldn't help it,
      couldn't stop—his pen touched the thread: "...and found exactly what he needed!"
      The thread froze. The glow died. The lantern went dark. "NO!" Noah grabbed at
      the thread, but it was too late. He stared at his hands. "I was so close. Why
      is waiting so hard?"
