description: Noah climbs toward the Grove of Truth where the pool shows him all his fears and doubts, but when he tries to use the compass to dispel them, it doesn't work—something crucial is still missing.

visual: |
  Noah reaches the Grove of Truth—a circle of ancient oaks surrounding a crystalline pool
  that reflects the sky perfectly. The compass pulses powerfully here, almost vibrating in
  his hands. Noah kneels at the pool's edge, gazing at his reflection. But something's
  wrong—the reflection shows not just him, but shadow-versions of all his fears and doubts
  swirling in the water. His expression shows realization: to find the truth, he must face
  himself.

  Noah climbed higher, feeling different now—lighter. The compass wasn't just showing him
  where to go. It was showing him who he was becoming. At the Grove of Truth, the pool showed
  Noah every fear he'd ever had—every wrong turn, every failed choice. He tried to use the
  compass to clear the shadows, but they only grew stronger. "Why isn't it working?" His old
  friend, doubt, crept back in. The compass pointed onward—toward a cliff he could barely see.
  "I don't know if I can," he whispered.
