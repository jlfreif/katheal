      Noah sprints between barriers like the action hero from his story, but it's real movement,
      real athletic skill. He solves part of one puzzle, races to another to complete the sequence,
      back to a third. Jump, climb, manipulate symbols, drop, run, repeat. His basketball agility
      and climbing skills are essential—vaulting over fallen pillars, swinging from branches, scaling
      mechanisms. This is the adventure he imagined when writing—but experiencing it is thrilling in
      a completely different way. Behind him, barriers dissolve as he gets sequences right. Stories
      pour free, swirling around him. He's actually doing it! Then he sees it: the master lock at
      the center. His climax scene. The one he wrote as: "The hero climbed to the highest lock and
      solved it." But the real version—forty feet up in actively collapsing architecture. His
      expression shows exhilaration meeting real fear. The atmosphere is exciting progress meeting
      the reality of his own climactic scene. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah raced between locks, solving them together. North wall—Bear faces Hunter. East wall—Arrow into position. South wall—pressure sequence. Click-click-click! Barriers dissolved. Stories burst free. He was doing it! Actually living his adventure! Then he saw the master lock. His climax scene. He'd written: "The hero climbed up and solved it." Simple words. The real version was forty feet up in crumbling stone, branches falling, everything collapsing. He'd described this. Now he had to live it.

    focus: Facing the complication
    visual: |
      Noah stands at the base of the collapsing section, looking up at the scene he wrote. In his
      story, the climb was one sentence: "The hero scaled the dangerous architecture." Actually doing
      it—chunks of stone crashing down, branches snapping—is completely different. The owl appears
      beside him. "That lock controls the Heart Crystal," it says. "Solve it and all barriers fall.
      But you'll need to solve the puzzle while hanging on in the collapse." Noah stares up. He wrote
      this scene at his desk in five minutes. Living it will take every bit of courage and skill he
      has. He studies the route—that branch, that ledge, that beam, up to the lock he designed. His
      own creation. His own challenge. His expression shows determination facing real fear—there's a
      huge difference between writing danger and facing it. The atmosphere is accepting the hardest
      challenge of his own making. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Forty feet up. Falling stone. His climax scene. Noah stared. In his story, he'd typed: "The hero climbed up." One sentence. Took him five seconds to write. Doing it would take everything he had. The owl watched. "Your choice, Noah. You wrote this challenge. Can you face it?" He looked at the path. His own creation. His own test. He tested his grip, rolled his shoulders. "I wrote an adventure," he said. "Time to live it." He jumped for the first handhold.
