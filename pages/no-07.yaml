      A magical library where golden story-threads float in the air like ribbons, forming words
      and sentences. Noah stands on a floating platform of books, hands outstretched toward a
      nearly-complete story that shimmers before him. The words glow: "And then she discovered..."
      with the ending hovering just out of reach. He's so close—the story is almost finished.
      Other completed stories float around him, their threads woven into solid, glowing narratives.
      A candle burns on a nearby floating desk, its flame bright and steady. His expression shows
      intense focus and hope. The atmosphere crackles with almost-success.

      Noah reached for the story's ending, watching it form word by word. He could almost grasp it. The perfect conclusion, the right resolution. The story pulsed, nearly complete. Around him, other stories hung finished and whole, proof that it could be done. The candle flame burned steady and bright. Just a little more.

      The story-thread slips through Noah's fingers and changes, the ending shifting to something
      different than what he planned. He stands with arms outstretched, face showing frustration
      and confusion as the words rearrange themselves. The candle flame flickers wildly but
      doesn't go out, casting dancing shadows. The story isn't ending how he wanted, but it's
      still ending—its threads weaving into a pattern he didn't predict. In the distance, through
      the floating books, he can see a door he hadn't noticed before, glowing faintly. His
      expression shifts from control to acceptance. The atmosphere is uncertain but alive with
      possibility.

      The ending shifted. Changed. Became something he hadn't planned. Noah tried to guide it back, but the story had its own ideas. The candle flickered but stayed lit. "I'm not in control," he whispered. "The story is. And maybe that's okay." Through the shelves, he spotted a door glowing faintly. That's where he'd find what he needed. Not in controlling the ending, but in trusting it.
