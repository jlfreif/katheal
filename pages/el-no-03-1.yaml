      Noah stands frozen at a three-way fork in the forest path, staring at his wildly spinning
      compass. His posture shows indecision—shoulders hunched, one foot forward but weight back.
      Suddenly, from the left path, Ellie bursts into view mid-run, chasing a magnificent
      paperbird whose wings shift from sunset-orange to sky-blue. She's laughing, breathless,
      carrying a sketchbook. They nearly collide—Noah jumps back, Ellie skids to a stop.
      The paperbird circles overhead, wings flashing colors.

      Noah jumped as someone burst through the trees—his sister Ellie, giggling and breathless.
      "The paths crossed us again!" she said, eyes bright. Noah clutched his spinning compass tighter.

      The siblings stand facing each other at the fork. Ellie, energetic and paint-stained,
      gestures animatedly at the three paths, paperbird perched on her shoulder. Noah shows her
      the compass, needle spinning uselessly. His expression is anxious, questioning. Ellie's
      face radiates easy confidence—shrugging shoulders, relaxed smile. Behind them, the three
      paths stretch into different mysteries: misty cliffs, glowing hollow, thorny silver flowers.
      Light filters through the canopy above.

      "Why are you waiting?" Ellie asked, tilting her head. "Just pick one!"
      "What if it's the wrong one?" Noah's voice cracked slightly. Ellie grinned and squeezed
      his shoulder. "Then we'll find another. Paths aren't trapped doors, Noah."
