      Front cover illustration. Max (12 years old, straight red hair neatly parted down the
      middle, slim build, tall and athletic, black t-shirt, light blue basketball shorts,
      blue basketball shoes) stands confidently, holding a basketball that's transforming
      into golden threads and magical patterns. His expression is witty and determined, a
      slight smile showing his humor. Golden threads swirl around him, forming musical notes
      (representing his trombone), comedic symbols, and pathway patterns (representing his
      love of patterns and mysteries). Behind him, the Library of Kathaél rises with glowing
      shelves, and the Heart Crystal towers in the background, its facets creating prismatic
      light. Some threads form question marks and puzzle pieces, showing his inquisitive nature.
      The atmosphere is energetic and bright, with watercolor washes of vibrant blues, honey
      golds, and warm creams. Delicate ink linework defines the threads and architectural
      details. The scene captures Max's analytical wit meeting magical adventure.

      At the top of the cover, in elegant script: "The Library of Kathaél"
      Below that, in bold lettering: "Max's Journey"
      At the bottom: "Courage to Keep Going After a Mistake"
