      Mona kneels by her tower in the Library, trying everything she knows to balance the golden block.
      She looks at the three spots on top—they look the same. She feels them—all smooth. She asks "Why
      this one?" but gets no answer. The spots don't glow or warm up like the other blocks did earlier.
      No clues! She tries placing the block very slowly. Still rolls off. She tries fast. Still rolls
      off. She tries gentle hands. Still rolls off! Around her through the Library windows, the sky dims
      slightly—the Heart Crystal needs this tower complete. Other creatures watch nervously. Mona sits
      down hard, exhausted, frustrated that her investigating isn't helping. Her expression shows tired
      determination. This is genuinely hard. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona tried everything! Looked at the spots. Same! Felt them. Same! "Why this one?" No answer! No clues! The sky got dark. Mona sat down. So tired. So stuck!

    visual: |
      Mona hugs her stuffed bunny close, resting for a moment on the Library floor. She's tired from
      trying so many times, tired from investigating, and this balance puzzle won't give her answers.
      The rabbit hops over between floating books. "Some puzzles have no clues," it says gently.
      "Sometimes you ask why all you can, then you just have to try and see what happens." Mona looks
      at the three spots on top of her tower again through the Library air. She can't know for sure
      which spot will hold the block. But she can make her best guess and try. That's all anyone can
      do with an impossible puzzle. Her expression shows tired acceptance—not of defeat, but of doing
      her best. She stands up, ready to try. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona hugged her bunny. The rabbit came. "Some puzzles have no clues. You ask why. Then you just try!" Mona looked at the spots. She didn't know which one. But she could try! She stood up.
