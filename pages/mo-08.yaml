      Mona sits slumped on the mossy ground at the base of a massive tree, looking up at the
      impossibly high Heart Crystal above. She looks exhausted for the first time, her usual
      bright energy dimmed. Her small shoulders droop. The threads around her still glow from
      her earlier help, but the high threads remain dark and unreachable. Twilight deepens
      into night. She rubs her eyes with one small fist. A stuffed bunny she brought from home
      sits beside her, looking equally tired.

      Mona was tired. She'd tried climbing trees but couldn't reach high enough. She'd called
      to the threads but they didn't come down. Her legs hurt from so much walking. For the
      first time since coming to this magical place, she felt small. Really, really small. She
      sat down hard and rubbed her eyes. "Too far," she whispered.

    visual: |
      Mona lies curled on her side on the soft moss, hugging her stuffed bunny close. Her eyes
      are closed, nearly asleep from exhaustion. But as she rests, something beautiful happens:
      the threads she helped earlier begin to drift down around her like a gentle blanket of
      light, drawn by her honest weariness. They glow softly, creating a cocoon of warmth. The
      rabbit from earlier hops close, keeping watch. Small fireflies join the glow. Her face
      relaxes into peace. The threads respond to her authentic presence, tired or not.

      Mona closed her eyes, hugging her bunny. Maybe she was too little to help the big
      threads. Maybe two-year-olds couldn't fix everything. But then she felt warmth. The
      threads she'd already helped floated down around her like a hug, glowing softly. They
      wrapped her in light, as if saying thank you. She wasn't alone. She'd helped so many already.
