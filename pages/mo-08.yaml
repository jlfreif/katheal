      Mona sits on the ground clutching the seed pod and her bunny, tears streaming down her face.
      Around her, the garden begins reverting—the fountain slowing again, flowers closing, golden
      threads dimming. "Why won't it tell me where?" she sobs. "Why don't I know? Why is it so
      hard?" She's spiraling back into endless questions, paralyzed again. The seed pod grows
      dimmer in her hands. Other creatures watch sadly. The progress she made is unraveling. Her
      expression shows toddler overwhelm and fear. The atmosphere is regression to the starting
      problem.

      Mona sat clutching the seed. "Why won't it tell me? Why don't I know? Why why why?" Tears streamed. The garden dimmed. Everything she'd fixed started breaking again. Too many questions. Not enough trust. She was stuck like the fountain had been.

      Mona hugs her stuffed bunny close, crying into its worn fur. But as she holds it, she feels
      its familiar softness, remembers all the times she's carried it without asking why it comforts
      her—she just knew it did. Her breathing slows. She looks up at the garden with new eyes.
      Some things you just know in your tummy without asking why. The bunny's button eyes seem to
      look back wisely. A faint golden thread connects her heart to the ground beneath her feet.
      Her expression begins to shift from despair to recognition. The atmosphere lightens with
      remembered instinct.

      Bunny pressed against her chest. Soft. Familiar. Mona never asked why bunny made her feel better. She just knew. Some things you felt in your tummy. Not in your head. The tortoise's voice came back: "Question when it matters. Act when it's time." She looked at the ground beneath her. It felt right.
