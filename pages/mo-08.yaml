      The base of the enormous twisty slide. From this angle it looks impossibly tall and scary.
      Mona sits on the ground at its base, looking very tiny compared to the slide's height. She
      hugs her bunny close, her usual bright smile gone. Around her, the other toys are happy
      and working, but the big slide stays dark and cold. Shadows seem to grow longer. Her
      expression shows real toddler fear and doubt—not dramatic despair but simple, genuine "I
      can't do this." The atmosphere feels overwhelming, the challenge too big for someone so
      small.

      Mona sat at the bottom feeling very small. Too tall. Too twisty. Too scary. Her eyes got hot. "I can't."

      Mona still sitting, but she looks at her stuffed bunny in her arms. The bunny seems to
      look back at her with button eyes, patient and loving. Mona touches the bunny's worn ear—
      her comfort object that's been with her through every new thing she's ever tried. First
      steps. First foods. First playground. The bunny reminds her she's tried scary things before.
      A tiny golden thread appears between Mona and the slide, faint but present. Her expression
      begins to shift from defeat to thoughtful consideration. The atmosphere lightens slightly,
      remembering strength.

      Bunny looked at her with wise button eyes. Bunny had been with her for every new thing. Walking. First slide. All scary. But she'd tried them anyway. She didn't have to be big. Just brave.
