      Mona kneels by the three spots, investigating with everything she knows. She examines the
      soil—looks the same. She checks for warmth—all equally warm. She looks for patterns in the
      grass—nothing. She asks "Why this one?" but gets no answer. The spots don't react like the
      puzzle pieces did. No clues! Around her, parts of the garden start to dim again—the spell
      weakening without the seed planted. Time pressure mounting. Other creatures watch nervously.
      Mona sits down hard, exhausted from the chase, frustrated that her usual investigating isn't
      working. Her expression shows tired determination, not breakdown. This puzzle is genuinely
      hard.

      Mona tried everything. Checked the soil. Same. Felt for warmth. Same. Looked for patterns. Nothing. "Why this one?" she asked. No answer. The spots didn't glow or react. No clues at all! Behind her, the garden started dimming. Running out of time. She sat down, tired and stuck. This puzzle wasn't giving her anything to investigate.

      Mona hugs her stuffed bunny close, resting for a moment. She's tired from running, tired from
      investigating, and this puzzle won't give her answers. The rabbit hops over. "Some puzzles
      don't have clues," it says gently. "Sometimes you investigate all you can, then you just have
      to try and see what happens." Mona looks at the three spots again. She can't know for sure
      which is right. But she can make her best guess and try. That's all anyone can do with an
      impossible puzzle. Her expression shows tired acceptance—not of defeat, but of doing her best
      with a genuinely hard challenge. She stands up, ready to try.

      Mona hugged bunny tight. She was so tired. The rabbit hopped close. "Some puzzles don't have clues. You investigate what you can. Then you try and see." Mona looked at the spots. She couldn't know for sure. But she could make her best guess. That was all anyone could do. She stood up. Time to try.
