    focus: The emotional low point

    visual: |
      Mona stands facing away from the cliff, her glowing block nearly dark
      now, held loosely in one hand. She's turned back toward the direction
      of home, tears on her cheeks. The world around her is the most faded
      we've seen it—almost monochrome, with just hints of color remaining.
      Even the sky looks gray. Her posture shows defeat, shoulders hunched,
      head down. The cliff looms behind her, impossible and uncaring.

      Mona turned away from the cliff. Her block was almost dark now, barely
      glowing at all. Everything looked gray and sad and tired. She wanted to
      go home. Home to Mama and her regular blocks and her soft mat at Gymboree
      where the towers were just the right size for little hands. She'd tried
      so hard. She'd been so brave. But brave wasn't enough when you were this
      small. "Want to go home," she whispered, bottom lip trembling.

    focus: The spark of hope returns

    visual: |
      The creatures Mona has helped throughout her journey gather around her—
      the blue butterfly, the spotted bunny, the wise turtle, even the flower-
      bells seem to lean toward her. They form a circle of support around the
      small girl. The butterfly lands on her shoulder. The bunny nuzzles her
      hand. The turtle meets her eyes with ancient wisdom. Mona looks up,
      surprised, as their presence makes the glowing block pulse slightly
      brighter in her hand.

      Soft wings brushed Mona's cheek. The butterfly landed on her shoulder,
      blue and bright. "You helped me try," it said. The spotted bunny hopped
      over, nuzzling her hand. The turtle smiled his slow smile. "You taught
      us courage, little one," he rumbled. "Trying isn't just for one. Sometimes
      trying means trying together." Mona's eyes widened. Together? Her block
      pulsed a little brighter. She'd never thought about that. Maybe... maybe
      she didn't have to climb alone?
