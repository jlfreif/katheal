      Mona kneels by the constellation pedestal in the Library, investigating the three connection
      spots with everything she knows. She examines the star patterns—they look the same. She checks
      for glowing threads—all equally bright. She looks for constellation alignments—nothing clear.
      She asks "Why this one?" but gets no answer. The spots don't react like the puzzle pieces did
      earlier. No clues! Around her through the Library windows, parts of the sky start to dim—the
      constellations weakening without the star placed. Time pressure mounting. Other creatures watch
      nervously. Mona sits down hard, exhausted from the chase, frustrated that her usual investigating
      isn't working. Her expression shows tired determination, not breakdown. This puzzle is genuinely
      hard. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona tried everything in the Library. Checked the star patterns. Same. Felt for warmth. Same. Looked for alignments. Nothing. "Why this one?" she asked. No answer. The spots didn't glow or react. No clues at all! Through the windows, constellations started dimming. Running out of time. She sat down, tired and stuck. This puzzle wasn't giving her anything to investigate.

      Mona hugs her stuffed bunny close, resting for a moment on the Library floor. She's tired from
      running, tired from investigating, and this constellation puzzle won't give her answers. The
      rabbit hops over between floating books. "Some puzzles don't have clues," it says gently.
      "Sometimes you investigate all you can, then you just have to try and see what happens." Mona
      looks at the three spots on the pedestal again through the Library air. She can't know for sure
      which is right. But she can make her best guess and try. That's all anyone can do with an impossible
      puzzle. Her expression shows tired acceptance—not of defeat, but of doing her best with a genuinely
      hard challenge. She stands up, ready to try. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Mona hugged bunny tight in the Library. She was so tired. The rabbit hopped close. "Some puzzles don't have clues. You investigate what you can. Then you try and see." Mona looked at the constellation spots. She couldn't know for sure. But she could make her best guess. That was all anyone could do. She stood up. Time to try.
