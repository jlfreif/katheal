    focus: Max completes his challenge using athleticism and persistence

      Max's facet shows complex aerial obstacles shifting faster and faster. He keeps moving -
      jumping, adjusting mid-air, climbing, flowing with the changes. His athletic skills and
      puzzle-solving combine - reading the pattern while executing the movements. Around him, his
      family calls encouragement. He's tired, muscles burning, but doesn't stop. The final
      obstacle appears - three paths, all moving. He watches the rhythm, feels the pattern, jumps.
      Lands. His facet blazes brilliant orange. The others are succeeding too. Text in Times New

      Max's obstacles shifted faster. He kept going. Jump. Adjust. Climb. Flow. His family called encouragement. "You've got this, Max!" He was tired. His muscles burned. But he didn't stop. He adjusted, adapted, kept moving. The final obstacle appeared—three paths, all moving. He watched the rhythm, felt the pattern, and jumped. He landed. His facet blazed brilliant orange.

    focus: Crystal heals - victory through teamwork
    visual: |
      All six facets glow together in brilliant colors. The Heart Crystal's cracks seal with
      golden light flooding through. The broken courses throughout Kathaél repair themselves,
      visible in the distance. Max feels warmth gather in his palm - a golden wristband appears,
      pulsing gently with orange light. He grins at his cousins, all equally exhausted and
      triumphant. They're together, victorious. The forest brightens around them. Text in Times

      All six facets glowed together. The Heart Crystal's cracks sealed, light flooding through every thread in Kathaél. The broken courses repaired themselves, stronger than before. Max felt warmth gather in his palm until a wristband appeared—golden, pulsing gently with orange light. He grinned at his cousins. They'd done it. Together. "Did NOT see a family reunion in a magical forest on today's schedule," he joked. Everyone laughed.
