    focus: All six children completing their challenges with skills learned on their journeys
    visual: |
      All six children work on their challenges simultaneously, each at their own facet. The focal
      character (varies by book POV) is shown in the foreground completing their specific challenge
      with intensity and joy. Around them, the other five family members are visible working on their
      own challenges—dancing, painting, moving, exploring, solving obstacles, writing. Challenges
      intensify visibly: patterns multiply, sequences speed up, complexity increases. All six children
      are tired, muscles burning from their long journeys, but nobody stops. Final impossible sequences
      appear for each. They launch together with determination. All six succeed simultaneously. All
      six facets blaze brilliant in their colors.

      The challenges intensified. Patterns faster. Strokes multiplied. Sequences sped up. Puzzles grew complex. One hand on the crystal. Bodies moving. "You've got this!" they called. "I do NOT got this!" Max joked. But nobody stopped. Tired. Muscles burning. The Library needed them. Final sequences appeared. The impossible ones. They launched together. All six perfect. All six facets blazed bright.

    focus: Crystal heals - victory through teamwork
    visual: |
      All six facets glow together in brilliant colors (blue, pink, green, orange, red, yellow).
      The Heart Crystal's cracks seal with golden light flooding through. Everything throughout
      Kathaél repairs simultaneously, visible in the distance. Warmth gathers in six palms—six
      golden wristbands appear, each pulsing gently with its own color. All six children grin at
      each other, equally exhausted and triumphant. They're together, victorious. The forest
      brightens around them.

      All six facets glowed together. The Heart Crystal's cracks sealed. Light flooding through. Golden light spread through the Library. Books glowed. Scrolls chimed. Pedestals blazed. Stories flowed again. Every courage story saved. Warmth gathered in six palms. Six wristbands appeared. Golden. Blue. Pink. Green. Orange. Red. Yellow. They'd done it. Together. Saved the Library. "Did NOT see a family reunion in a magical forest on today's schedule," Max joked. Everyone laughed.
