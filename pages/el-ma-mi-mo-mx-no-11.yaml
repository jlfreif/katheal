      The Heart Crystal pulses. Dark energy crackles from the cracks. Fights back. The six children
      hold their positions. Elise dances at the blue facet, powerful movements creating ripples of
      music. Maya paints bold strokes of color on the pink facet. Micah climbs and leaps around the
      green facet, never stopping. Mona toddles to the orange facet asking "Why? Why? Why?" Max
      traces patterns on the red facet, analyzing the crystal's structure. Noah writes glowing words
      on the yellow facet with his golden quill. The crystal resists. Shadows push back. But they
      don't let go. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The crystal fought. Dark lightning crackled from the cracks. Pushed them back. "It's fighting us!" Elise shouted. Noah gritted his teeth. "Then we show it we won't give up!" Elise danced. Maya painted. Micah climbed. Mona questioned. Max analyzed. Noah wrote. Each doing what they'd learned. Together.

      The cracks seal. One by one. Golden light pours from each facet as the children's courage
      overcomes the darkness. The blue facet hums with Elise's music. The pink facet blazes with
      Maya's colors. The green facet vibrates with Micah's movement. The orange facet glows with
      Mona's curiosity. The red facet sparks with Max's ideas. The yellow facet shimmers with Noah's
      stories. All six facets blaze brilliant. The crystal whole. Perfect. Radiant. Golden threads
      shoot into the sky, spreading across Kathaél. The forest brightens. Colors return. The children
      stand together, exhausted but triumphant. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The cracks sealed. One by one. "It's working!" Max shouted. "The cracks are sealing!" Darkness retreated. Light poured from each facet. Golden. Brilliant. The crystal blazed whole. Perfect. Golden threads shot into the sky. Across Kathaél. Everything brightened. The children stood together. Exhausted. Victorious. "We did it," Maya breathed. "We actually did it."
