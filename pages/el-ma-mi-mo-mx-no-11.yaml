    focus: Elise completes her dance challenge with technique plus joy
    visual: |
      Elise's blue facet shows rhythm-footprints shifting faster and faster in the air around her.
      She keeps dancing—one hand pressed to the crystal, the other arm extended for balance. Spin,
      leap, pop-and-lock, rapid steps. She adds joy to every move—laughs mid-spin, adds flourishes,
      dances with her whole heart. Her family calls encouragement around her—Max completing obstacles,
      Noah writing, Maya painting, Micah moving, Mona exploring. All six working together. Elise is
      tired, muscles burning from her long journey, but she doesn't stop. The final sequence appears—
      the impossible triple-spin combination. She launches into it with technique plus joy. Lands
      perfect. Her facet blazes brilliant blue. The others are succeeding too. Text in Times New

Around her, her family completed their own challenges. "You've got this!" they called to each other. Elise was tired. Muscles burning. But she didn't stop. The final sequence appeared—the impossible combination. She launched with technique plus joy. Landed perfect. Her blue facet blazed bright.

    focus: Crystal heals - victory through teamwork

      All six facets glow together in brilliant colors. The Heart Crystal's cracks seal with
      golden light flooding through. The broken courses throughout Kathaél repair themselves,
      visible in the distance. Max feels warmth gather in his palm - a golden wristband appears,
      pulsing gently with orange light. He grins at his cousins, all equally exhausted and
      triumphant. They're together, victorious. The forest brightens around them. Text in Times

      All six facets glowed together. The Heart Crystal's cracks sealed, light flooding through every thread in Kathaél. The broken rhythm-paths repaired themselves, stronger than before. Elise felt warmth gather in her palm until a wristband appeared—golden, pulsing gently with blue light. She grinned at her family. They'd done it. Together. Max joked, "Did NOT see a family reunion in a magical forest on today's schedule." Everyone laughed.
