      A dim glade where golden threads that once shimmered brightly are fading to dull grey before
      their eyes. Flowers wilt and lose their glow. The air feels heavy and tired. Micah stumbles
      into the clearing, his usually energetic posture slumped, clothes dusty, face showing deep
      fatigue. Noah sits on a mossy log, head in his hands, shoulders hunched. Around them, the
      evidence of their separate journeys shows in scattered broken attempts—snapped threads,
      faded crystals, wilted plants. The forest seems to dim further with each passing moment.
      The atmosphere is one of defeat and growing darkness.

      Micah dragged himself into the glade where golden threads were fading to dull grey. Everything was dimming. He'd run out of ideas and energy. Noah looked up from the mossy log with tired eyes. "I can't do this anymore," Micah said, voice cracking. "I've tried everything." Noah's laugh was bitter. "Me too. Every time I think I've got it, I mess it up again."

    visual: |
      Both boys sit together on the mossy log, Micah with his head thrown back staring at the
      darkening sky, Noah with elbows on knees, hands clasped. Between them, a single golden
      thread still glows faintly, refusing to die completely. Micah's eyes shift to notice it,
      then to look at Noah. Noah turns to look at Micah at the same moment. Their eyes meet
      with shared exhaustion but also recognition. The single stubborn thread brightens slightly,
      responding to their connection. Around them, the fading continues, but that one thread
      holds steady, warm and golden. The smallest hint of hope glimmers in both their expressions.

      They sat in heavy silence, watching Kathaél fade around them. But Micah noticed something. One thread between them still glowed, stubborn and warm. "You're still here though," he said quietly. Noah looked up. "So are you." The thread pulsed brighter. Maybe showing up mattered. Maybe trying, even when failing, counted for something.
