      A dim glade where golden threads fade to grey. Incomplete puzzles float, pieces scattered.
      Constellation fragments dim. Word tiles jumbled. Mechanisms frozen. Micah stumbles into the
      clearing, exhausted, shoulders slumped. Clothes disheveled from repeated attempts. Breathing
      hard. Noah sits on a mossy log, head in hands, shoulders hunched. Around them, evidence of
      failed attempts—unsolved challenges, fading magic. The forest dims further. The air feels heavy
      with accumulated failure.

        They tried again. And again. The challenges reset each time—harsh clangs, discordant crashes. Both cousins stumbled into the same dim glade, exhausted, not expecting to find each other. "Noah?" "Micah?" They stared at each other from across the clearing. Noah sank onto a mossy log. "I'm so tired," he said quietly. Micah collapsed beside him. "Me too. I keep failing. Over and over." The weight of it pressed down on both of them.

      Micah and Noah sit on the mossy log. Micah stares at the darkening sky, shoulders slumped.
      Noah hunches forward, elbows on knees. Between them, one golden thread glows faintly. Refusing
      to die. A single puzzle piece hovers, still bright. Their eyes shift to it, then to each other.
      Eyes meet. Exhausted but recognizing each other. Not alone. The thread brightens slightly.
      Around them, fading continues. But that one thread holds steady, responding to their connection.

        Heavy silence between them. Micah stared at the fading forest. "Seven tries," he said quietly. "Seven failures. What if I just... can't do it?" Noah looked at him. Then noticed the single thread still glowing between them. One puzzle piece still bright. "But you're still here," Noah said. "Still trying. That takes courage." Micah looked up, met his cousin's eyes. "You too." The thread glowed warmer. Maybe showing up—even after failure—mattered most. They stood together, steadier now. "Let's keep going."
      no: |
        Heavy silence between them. Noah stared at the scattered puzzles. "I can't coordinate them all," he said quietly. "Every time, one falls out of sync. What if I'm just... not good enough?" Micah looked at him. Then noticed the single thread still glowing between them. One puzzle piece still bright. "But you're still here," Micah said. "Still trying. That's brave." Noah looked up, met his cousin's eyes. "So are you." The thread glowed warmer. Maybe showing up—even after repeated failure—mattered most. They stood together, steadier now. "Let's keep going."
