      A dim glade where golden threads fade to grey. Incomplete puzzles float, pieces scattered.
      Constellation fragments dim. Word tiles jumbled. Mechanisms frozen. Micah stumbles into the
      clearing, exhausted, dusty. Noah sits on a mossy log, head in hands, shoulders hunched. Around
      them, failed attempts. Unsolved challenges. The forest dims further. The air feels heavy. Text

      Micah dragged himself into the glade. Everything fading. Threads turning grey. Puzzles falling apart. "Noah?" His cousin looked up with tired eyes. "I'm so tired," Noah said. Micah collapsed beside him. "Me too."

    focus: Inner doubt and discouragement
    visual: |
      Both boys sit on the mossy log. Micah stares at the darkening sky. Noah hunches forward, elbows
      on knees. Between them, one golden thread glows faintly. Refusing to die. A single puzzle piece
      hovers, still bright. Micah's eyes shift to it. Then to Noah. Noah turns to Micah. Their eyes
      meet. Exhausted but recognizing each other. The thread brightens slightly. Around them, fading
      continues. But that one thread holds steady. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at
      bottom.

      They sat. Heavy silence. "Everything's so hard," Micah said. Noah nodded. Then noticed the single thread still glowing between them. One puzzle piece still bright. "But we're still here," Noah said quietly. "Still trying." Micah looked up. "Yeah. We are." The thread glowed warmer. Maybe showing up—even exhausted—mattered most. They stood together. "Let's keep going."
