      A dim glade where golden threads fade to grey. Flowers wilt. Lose their glow. Micah stumbles
      into the clearing, exhausted, clothes dusty. Noah sits on a mossy log, head in hands, shoulders
      hunched. Around them, broken attempts. Snapped threads. Faded crystals. Wilted plants. The
      forest dims further. The air feels heavy. Defeated. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space

      Micah dragged himself into the glade. Everything fading. Threads turning grey. Flowers dying. "Noah?" His cousin looked up with tired eyes. "I can't do this anymore," Micah said. Noah's laugh was bitter. "Me too."

    focus: Inner doubt and discouragement
    visual: |
      Both boys sit on the mossy log. Micah stares at the darkening sky. Noah hunches forward, elbows
      on knees. Between them, one golden thread glows faintly. Refusing to die. Micah's eyes shift
      to it. Then to Noah. Noah turns to Micah. Their eyes meet. Exhausted but recognizing each other.
      The thread brightens slightly. Around them, fading continues. But that one thread holds steady.
      Warm. Golden. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      They sat. Heavy silence. Micah's body still wanted to run, to move, to escape. But Noah sat so still, just thinking. "How do you do that?" Micah asked. "Just sit?" Noah blinked. "I pause to think. Stories need space to breathe." Micah stared. Pausing to think. Pausing to breathe. Same thing. The thread between them glowed warmer. "You're still here," Micah said quietly. Noah looked up. "So are you." Maybe showing up—even while being still—mattered most.
