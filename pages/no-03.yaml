      Noah climbs up ancient tree branches, using his climbing skills. Carved riddles glow on the bark. He
      solves them as he climbs higher. "What has roots nobody sees... A mountain!" The branch reveals a
      glowing constellation piece shaped like a star. Noah grabs it and slides back down the trunk, grinning.
      He's good at this! At the pedestal, he slots the star into place. The constellation pattern blazes
      brighter. Progress! Books chime approvingly. His expression shows excited confidence. The atmosphere
      celebrates success through skill.

At the pedestal, he placed the star. The constellation blazed brighter! Two pieces done, three to go on this pedestal alone. He was doing it!

      Noah returns to the central chamber, proud of his progress. But all five pedestals are now active. The
      Living Canvas pedestal pulses with urgent light. The musical notes pedestal chimes insistently. The
      mathematical sequences pedestal flashes numbers. The physical mechanisms pedestal rattles and spins.
      All at once. The owl appears beside Noah, who stares at the simultaneous activation. "The library is
      waking up," the owl explains gently. "Soon all five patterns will activate at the same time. You'll
      need to solve them simultaneously. One person can't be in five places at once." Noah looks at the five
      pedestals, then at the vast library. His expression shows realization, not defeat. He grins. The
      atmosphere is accepting a bigger challenge.

      Noah returned to the central chamber. All five pedestals glowed. Pulsing. Chiming. Flashing. Rattling. Activating together. The owl said quietly, "Soon they'll need solving at the same time. The patterns are connected." Noah looked around the massive library. Five pedestals. Five puzzle types. One him. He laughed. "This is a team challenge." He cracked his knuckles. "Time to find my teammates."
