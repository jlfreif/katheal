    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside a floating thread, notebook open, pen moving confidently.
      Glowing letters appear in the air beside the frozen story-words. The thread
      flickers, rejecting his ending, scattering his words like sparks. More failed
      attempts litter the mossy ground around him.

      "Okay, I can figure this out." Noah knelt beside the frozen story and uncapped
      his pen. "She reached for the door and found her brother waiting." He analyzed
      the pattern: reunion equals resolution. "Perfect!" Noah announced. The thread
      trembled... then spat his words back at him like watermelon seeds. Letters
      bounced off his forehead. "Ow! Okay, not perfect!"

    visual: |
      Noah sits against a tree trunk, surrounded by fading letters from failed
      endings bouncing off like rubber balls. His notebook shows crossed-out attempts.
      The frozen story-thread hangs incomplete nearby, unmoved. A fox with knowing
      eyes watches from the underbrush, looking almost amused.

      Five more endings. Ten. Every single one dissolved or bounced back. Noah sat
      back, puzzled. "Weird. Those were solid endings." The fox in the underbrush
      chittered, and somehow Noah understood: Right for who? Noah tilted his head.
      "You mean... the stories want something different?" The fox flicked its tail
      and trotted deeper into the forest. Noah jumped up. "Wait, are you taking me
      somewhere?"
