      Noah sits surrounded by floating pages, creating an elaborate plan for freeing the stories.
      He's made charts showing which chains to remove in what order, schedules for optimal story
      liberation, detailed protocols. He holds a glowing quill like a scalpel, working with intense
      precision. "This is it—the perfect solution. I've analyzed everything. This will work." He
      works methodically, confident this clever approach will succeed on the first try. His face shows deep concentration.
      The atmosphere is careful, calculated intervention. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white

      Noah made a plan. One brilliant solution for freeing stories. He'd analyzed the problem, studied the patterns, figured it all out. "This will work," he said confidently. "I've thought through everything. The perfect approach." He worked carefully, precisely, executing his clever plan. "I'll save you," he told the stories. "I've got it all figured out."

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work
    visual: |
      The stories Noah "rescued" with his perfect plan are now wrapped in NEW chains—golden ones that
      formed from his approach. "The story must heal this way. The characters must grow like
      this." His clever solution didn't work—it made things worse. The stories gasp, still trapped.
      An old owl appears on a branch, shaking its head. Noah stares at the golden chains coming
      from his own hands, frozen. His expression shows shock and defeat. The atmosphere is the realization
      that one clever attempt wasn't enough. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at

      The stories Noah "freed" were still chained. New chains. Golden ones. His "perfect solution" had failed. Made things worse. Noah stared, frozen. "But... I figured it out. I had the right answer." The owl spoke softly. "One clever try is rarely enough, young writer. When something doesn't work, you must try differently. And again. And again. That's the real courage."
