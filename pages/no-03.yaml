    focus: Trying the obvious solution

    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside a floating thread, notebook open, pen moving confidently.
      He writes an ending in the air beside the frozen words. The letters glow
      briefly, then dissolve like smoke. Around him, crumpled attempts litter the
      mossy ground. His expression shows determined concentration.

      Noah pulled out his notebook. "She reached for the door and found her
      brother waiting with a smile." He wrote the ending in glowing letters.
      Perfect. Satisfying. The thread flickered—then rejected his words, scattering
      them like leaves. He tried again, crafting a twist ending. Same result.

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work

    visual: |
      Noah sits back against a tree trunk, surrounded by failed endings that
      shimmer and fade around him. His notebook lies open on his lap, filled with
      crossed-out attempts. The frozen story-thread still hangs incomplete nearby.
      A fox watches from the underbrush with sympathetic eyes.

      Every ending he wrote dissolved before it could stick. Noah slumped against
      a tree, frustrated. His endings were good—he knew they were good. Why wouldn't
      the stories accept them? A fox watched from nearby, its eyes seeming to say:
      maybe good isn't the same as right. But what did that even mean?
