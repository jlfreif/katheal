beat: "Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)"
hook: Simple solutions fail, prompting the question of who might have better answers.
payoff: A wise helper appears who offers new perspective or guidance.

description: Noah tries his first approach to solving the puzzle-lock, but the mechanism is more complex than expected and his solution triggers a defensive response.

      Noah leaps up and grabs onto the lower edge of the puzzle-lock mechanism, using his climbing
      skills to pull himself up. He hangs with one hand while manipulating the rotating rings with
      the other, matching symbols the way his analysis suggested. The rings click into place—star
      to moon, sun to comet. He reaches for the sliding panel, shifts it. Another click. Yes! He's
      getting it. He drops down, hits two pressure plates in sequence. The lock mechanism glows
      brighter. He's done it—or so he thinks. His expression shows focused intensity and growing
      confidence. The atmosphere is athletic problem-solving in action. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      Noah jumped and caught the edge of the lock mechanism, swinging himself up. He rotated the outer ring—star to moon. Click. Middle ring—sun to comet. Click. He dropped, landed smooth, hit the pressure plates one-two. The mechanism blazed bright. "Yes!" But then—

      The puzzle-lock flares red and resets itself with a harsh grinding noise. Worse—the barrier
      pulses and contracts, squeezing the trapped stories tighter. They flutter in panic. The ground
      shakes harder. New cracks spread. Noah stumbles back as a small owl swoops down from a nearby
      branch, landing on a fallen stone pillar. The owl tilts its head, studying him. "That was a
      good start," it says, voice patient but urgent. "But this lock has seven interlocking systems,
      not three. You'll need to solve them together—and in the right order—or it triggers defenses."
      Noah stares at the reset mechanism, then at the owl. Seven systems. He'd only mapped three.
      His expression shows surprise but determination—this is harder than he thought, but he's not
      giving up. The atmosphere is the realization that this will take more attempts. Text in Times

      The mechanism flared red. Grinding. Resetting. The barrier contracted—stories crushed tighter. "No!" Noah jumped back. An owl swooped down, landing nearby. "Good try," it said. "But that lock has seven systems working together. You found three." Noah looked up at the massive mechanism. Seven? He'd only seen three. "Show me," he said, pulling out his notebook again. "I'll try differently."
