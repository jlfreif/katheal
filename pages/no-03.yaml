      Noah kneels beside a floating thread, notebook open, pen moving confidently.
      Glowing letters appear in the air beside the frozen story-words. The thread
      flickers, rejecting his ending, scattering his words like sparks. More failed
      attempts litter the mossy ground around him.

      "Okay, this is what I do." Noah knelt beside the frozen story and uncapped
      his pen. "She reached for the door and found her brother waiting." He wrote
      the words in the air, watching them glow. "Perfect ending. Satisfying.
      Complete." The thread flickered once, then scattered his words like sparks.
      "What? That was good!"

    visual: |
      Noah sits against a tree trunk, surrounded by fading letters from failed
      endings. His notebook shows crossed-out attempts. The frozen story-thread
      hangs incomplete nearby, unmoved. A fox with knowing eyes watches from
      the underbrush.

      Five more endings. Ten. Every single one dissolved. Noah slumped against
      a tree, cheeks burning. "I don't get it. These are good endings." The fox
      in the underbrush tilted its head, and somehow Noah heard the question:
      Good for who? He opened his mouth to argue, then stopped. Maybe good
      wasn't the same as right. But what made an ending right?
