    visual: |
      Noah kneels beside the stream, notebook open in one hand, pen touching a
      frayed golden thread floating in the water. Several crumpled pages lie
      scattered around him on the moss. He leans forward intently, writing furiously,
      certain his clever words can fix the problem. The thread remains dull despite
      his efforts.

    text: |
      Noah pulled out his notebook. He was good with words, so words would fix this.
      He wrote "The thread was strong again" and touched his pen to the frayed
      strand. Nothing happened. He tried "Once upon a time the thread was whole."
      Still nothing. He crossed out line after line, his writing growing faster
      and messier.

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work

    visual: |
      Noah sits back on his heels, notebook sagging in his lap, surrounded by
      crumpled papers covered in crossed-out attempts. His brow furrows with
      frustration. The golden thread still drifts limp in the stream, completely
      unresponsive. A small fox watches from behind a silver-barked tree, eyes
      sympathetic but offering no help.

      His best phrases lay scattered and rejected on the ground. Noah stared at
      the broken thread, his jaw tight. Being clever wasn't working. The thread
      didn't care how good his words sounded. He rubbed his face with both hands,
      frustration building in his chest. Maybe someone in this strange forest knew
      something he didn't.
