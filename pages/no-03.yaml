      Noah kneels beside a floating thread, notebook open, pen moving confidently.
      Glowing letters appear in the air beside the frozen story-words. The thread
      flickers, rejecting his ending, scattering his words like sparks. More failed
      attempts litter the mossy ground around him.

      "Okay, I can figure this out." Noah knelt beside the frozen story and uncapped
      his pen. "She reached for the door and found her brother waiting." He analyzed
      the pattern: reunion equals resolution. "Perfect ending. Satisfying. Complete."
      The thread flickered once, then scattered his words like sparks. "What? I
      understood the structure!"

    visual: |
      Noah sits against a tree trunk, surrounded by fading letters from failed
      endings. His notebook shows crossed-out attempts. The frozen story-thread
      hangs incomplete nearby, unmoved. A fox with knowing eyes watches from
      the underbrush.

      Five more endings. Ten. Every single one dissolved. Noah slumped against
      a tree, cheeks burning. "I don't understand. I analyzed each pattern." The fox
      in the underbrush tilted its head, and somehow Noah heard the question:
      Understanding for who? He opened his mouth to argue, then stopped. Maybe
      understanding the structure wasn't the same as knowing what the story needed.
      But how could he help without understanding?
