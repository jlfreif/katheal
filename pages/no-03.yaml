description: Noah tries to fix a broken story-thread by rewriting it with clever words, but the magic doesn't respond to cleverness alone.

  Noah kneels beside a stream in Kathaél where a large golden thread has frayed and
  broken, its ends floating limply in the water. He holds his notebook open in his
  left hand and a pen in his right, writing furiously. Around him are several crumpled
  pages that he's tossed aside in frustration. He's leaning forward intently, trying
  to touch his pen to the broken thread as if writing could repair it, but the thread
  remains unresponsive—dull instead of glowing. His brow is furrowed in concentration
  and frustration. The stream flows gently around smooth stones, reflecting the soft
  light of Kathaél. On the bank beside him, a small pile of his attempted solutions:
  a paper with "The thread was strong again" written on it, another with "Once upon
  a time the thread was whole"—all crossed out. Forest surrounds the stream, with
  silver-barked trees and patches of luminescent mushrooms. A small fox with glowing
  eyes watches from behind a tree, looking sympathetic but not intervening. The
  broken thread drifts in the current, clearly needing something Noah hasn't figured
  out yet.

  Noah tried writing the thread back together with his best words and cleverest phrases. But the thread stayed broken, and he felt his frustration rising.
