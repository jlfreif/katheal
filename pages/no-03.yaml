      Noah sits surrounded by floating pages, creating an elaborate plan for freeing the stories.
      He's made charts showing which chains to remove in what order, schedules for optimal story
      liberation, detailed protocols. He holds a glowing quill like a scalpel, working with intense
      precision. "First remove chain A, then support plot point B, then guide the story to—" He
      works methodically, controlling every aspect of the rescue. His face shows deep concentration.
      The atmosphere is careful, calculated intervention. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white

      Noah made a plan. A perfect system for freeing stories. Step one: remove this chain. Step two: guide the story this way. Step three: ensure it goes here. He worked carefully, precisely, controlling the rescue. "I'll save you," he told the stories. "Just follow my system."

      The stories Noah "rescued" with his system are now wrapped in NEW chains—golden ones that
      he created with his control. "The story must heal this way. The characters must grow like
      this." He replaced the old control with his own control. The stories gasp, still trapped.
      An old owl appears on a branch, shaking its head. Noah stares at the golden chains coming
      from his own hands. His expression shows dawning horror. The atmosphere is the realization
      that good intentions don't excuse control. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at

      The stories Noah "freed" were still chained. New chains. Golden ones. His chains. "The character must grow this way. The story must heal like that. The ending must be—" He'd just replaced one controller with another. The owl spoke softly. "You cannot free stories by controlling their freedom, young writer. You must let go."
