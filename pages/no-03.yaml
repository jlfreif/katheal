      Noah kneels beside a story that's still fighting to survive—a tale about a girl trying to
      find her way home. It's wrapped in chains but struggling. The pages show her standing at a
      crossroads, uncertain which path to take. Noah reaches out with glowing hands (he can affect
      stories here as their author). "I can help you," he says. "I'll show you the right path. You
      don't need to waste time on wrong turns." He channels golden light into the book, mapping out
      the correct route, the perfect choices, the path with no mistakes. "There," he says
      confidently. "Now you can succeed without all that messy failing." The story glows brighter
      under his touch. He's helping! He's fixing it! His expression shows determined compassion—he's
      solving the problem. The atmosphere is well-intentioned control. Text in Times New Roman 16pt

      Noah grabbed a struggling story—a girl lost, trying to find her way home. Chains wrapped tight but it still fought. He could feel the story's uncertainty: which path? Golden light poured from his hands. "I'll help you," he said. "I'll show you the right way. You don't need to try every wrong path. Here—" He sketched the correct route into the pages. The perfect choice. No mistakes needed. "There. Now you can get home without failing." The story blazed brighter. He was helping!

      New golden chains erupt from Noah's "help"—wrapping around the story even tighter. The book
      convulses, gasping worse than before. Noah stumbles back in horror. His "solution" created
      MORE chains. The pages now show the girl walking a golden path—but she's not really choosing,
      not really trying, not really alive. Just following the route Noah gave her. Lifeless. The
      story is dying faster now. Other stories Noah "helped" the same way are also sprouting new
      chains: "Must follow this path" "Must make these choices" "Must succeed this way." The owl
      swoops down, shaking its head sadly. "You're still controlling them, Noah. Still telling them
      the 'right' way. That's just more chains. Stories don't need your perfect solutions. They need
      permission to try and fail and try again on their own." Noah stares at his hands in horror—he
      made it worse. The atmosphere is devastating realization that good intentions aren't enough.

      Golden chains exploded from Noah's "help"—wrapping tighter around the story. The girl on the pages walked the path he'd given her, but lifeless. Not choosing. Not trying. Just obeying. The story gasped, dying faster. Noah jerked back. "No! I was helping!" More chains wrapped around every story he'd "fixed." The owl landed beside him. "You're still controlling them. Still giving them the 'right' answers. That's the same as deletion—just prettier." Noah looked at his hands. "What do I do?" "Stop helping," the owl said. "Start letting go."
