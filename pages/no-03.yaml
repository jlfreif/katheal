      Noah sits on a moss-covered log in the forest library, surrounded by floating pages from
      the unfinished story. He holds a glowing quill, writing in the air. Golden words appear where
      the pen moves. His face shows concentration, tongue between teeth. The words glow bright.
      Tree branches hold watching stories. The golden thread pulses with hope. Ancient trees tower
      around him. Sunlight filters through leaves. His expression is determined and focused. Text

      Noah took the glowing quill and wrote carefully. "She found her voice in the crystal cave, singing louder than ever before." Perfect. Logical. Complete. The words glowed bright. Around him, the forest held its breath.

      The golden words turn grey and crumble like ash. The story's thread frays, nearly breaking.
      Noah lunges forward, grabbing it desperately. His face shows shock. The pages flutter in
      distress. Earlier words fade. Books on tree branches dim. Grey dust at his feet. A wise owl
      appears on a low branch, watching with knowing eyes. Noah's expression shifts from confidence
      to dismay. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      The words turned grey. Crumbled. Fell like ash. The thread frayed worse. Nearly snapped. Noah gasped and caught it. His perfect ending made things worse. An owl appeared. "Stories don't need perfect endings, young writer. They need true ones. You can't force truth."
