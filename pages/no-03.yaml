# Noah - Spread 3: First Attempt
# Emotional beat: CONFIDENCE → CONFUSION
# Escalation: Noah's usual approach fails completely
# World rule hint: Stories reject forced endings

id: no-03
spread: 3
node_type: solo
beat: "Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)"

hook: Simple solutions fail, prompting the question of who might have better answers.
payoff: A wise helper appears who offers new perspective or guidance.

description: Noah confidently tries multiple different approaches—writing endings, speaking them aloud, even acting them out with gestures—but each method fails in a visibly different way.

    visual: |
      Noah stands beside a floating thread, gesturing dramatically with both hands as he
      speaks an ending aloud. Glowing letters appear in the air, then bounce off the thread
      like rubber balls, scattering around him. His notebook lies open on the ground, already
      showing crossed-out attempts. More failed letter-fragments litter the mossy ground.

      "Okay, I can figure this out." Noah started writing endings, but the thread spat
      the words back. So he tried speaking them instead, hands moving expressively as he
      narrated. The letters bounced off him like dodgeballs. "Ow!" He dropped to the
      ground and tried acting it out, pantomiming a reunion scene. The thread whipped
      away from his reaching fingers.

    visual: |
      Noah paces back and forth in front of the frozen story-thread, running his hand
      through his hair in frustration. Failed letters dissolve in the air around him.
      His notebook shows three different methods attempted: written, spoken, performed.
      A fox with knowing eyes watches from the underbrush, looking almost amused.

      Noah paced, thinking hard. Writing didn't work. Speaking didn't work. Acting
      it out definitely didn't work. "What am I missing?" The fox in the underbrush
      chittered, and somehow Noah understood: Right for who? Noah stopped mid-stride.
      "You mean... the stories want something different?" The fox flicked its tail
      and trotted deeper into the forest. Noah grabbed his notebook and jogged after it.
