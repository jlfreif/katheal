      Noah sits cross-legged on a floating platform of books, surrounded by the unfinished story's
      pages that hover in the air around him. He has a glowing quill in hand, writing carefully
      in the air, golden words appearing where the pen moves. His face shows intense concentration,
      tongue between his teeth, working to craft the perfect ending. The words glow bright initially,
      seeming to work. Other floating pages lean in as if watching his progress. The golden thread
      attached to the story pulses with hope. The atmosphere is tense with focused effort and
      anticipation.

      Noah took the glowing quill and wrote carefully, crafting what he thought was the perfect ending. "And then she found her voice in the crystal cave, singing louder than ever before." Logical, satisfying, complete. The words glowed bright as he wrote them. Around him, the library seemed to hold its breath.

      The golden words Noah wrote suddenly turn grey and crumble, falling like ash. The story's
      thread frays worse than before, nearly breaking. Noah lurches forward, grabbing the thread
      desperately, his face showing shock and dismay. The pages of the story flutter in distress,
      some words actually fading from earlier paragraphs. Books around him dim further. His
      carefully crafted ending lies in grey dust at his feet. His expression shifts from
      confidence to confused distress. A wise-looking owl appears on a nearby floating shelf,
      watching him with knowing eyes. The atmosphere feels like a deflating balloon.

      The words turned grey and crumbled. The story's thread frayed worse, nearly snapping in his hands. Noah gasped, catching it before it broke completely. His perfect ending had made things worse. An owl appeared on a shelf, hooting softly. "Stories don't need perfect endings, young writer. They need true ones. And you can't force truth."
