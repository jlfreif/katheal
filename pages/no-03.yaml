      Noah leaps up and grabs the puzzle-lock mechanism, using his climbing skills to pull himself
      up. In his story, he wrote: "The hero rotated the outer ring to match star with moon, then
      the inner ring to align sun with comet, and the lock opened." He tries exactly that—hanging
      with one hand while manipulating the rings with the other. Star to moon—click. Sun to comet—
      click. Yes! Just like he wrote it! He drops down, confident. The lock glows brighter. He did
      it! His expression shows excited confidence—he created this world, he knows how it works. The
      atmosphere is initial success. Text in Times New Roman 16pt in white space at bottom.

      Noah jumped and caught the lock mechanism, swinging himself up. He knew this puzzle—he'd written it! "The hero rotated the outer ring, star to moon." Click. "Then the inner ring, sun to comet." Click. Perfect! Just like in his story. He dropped down, grinning. "I created this. I know how—"

    focus: Realizing it doesn't work
    visual: |
      The puzzle-lock flares angry red and resets with a harsh grinding noise. Worse—the barrier
      pulses and contracts violently, squeezing the trapped stories. They flutter in panic. The
      ground shakes harder. New cracks spread. Noah stumbles back, shocked. That should have worked!
      That's how he wrote it! A small owl swoops down from a nearby branch. "Your written version
      was simpler," it says gently. "This is the real Kathaél. The puzzle has seven systems, not
      two. They work together in ways you didn't imagine when you were just writing words." Noah
      stares at his notebook, then at the massive mechanism. He'd written a simple puzzle. His story
      world had created something far more complex. His expression shows surprise and humility—
      creating a world on paper and solving real problems in it are completely different. The
      atmosphere is the realization that knowing the author's intent isn't enough. Text in Times New

      The mechanism flared red. Grinding. Resetting. The barrier contracted—crushing the stories. "No! But that's how I wrote it!" An owl swooped down, landing nearby. "You wrote a simpler version," it said kindly. "Kathaél took your ideas and made them real. This lock has seven systems. Your story only described two." Noah looked up at the mechanism. Seven systems? He'd only imagined a simple puzzle. His world had grown beyond his words. "Show me," he said, notebook ready. "I need to learn how my own world actually works."
