    visual: |
      Maya stands at the Heart Crystal's base, hands pressed against the
      performance-facet. Through the clear surface, she sees other facets—
      one glowing with stories, one bright with restored challenges. Her
      authentic messy beautiful performance waits to be offered. Cracks
      spread across the crystal. Her hands tremble slightly.

      Maya stood at the Crystal's base, her wild authentic performance ready
      to offer. It wasn't proper. It wasn't what teachers would call correct.
      Through the crystal, she saw other facets glowing with their own truths.
      Her performance felt too loud, too much, too Maya. "What if it's not
      good enough?" she thought. But it was honest. It was hers.

    visual: |
      Maya dances her authentic performance into the Crystal facet—all her
      bold energy, mixed styles, playful spirit flowing as golden light.
      Where they connect, an explosion of color blazes out. Cracks seal
      with sounds like laughter. Golden threads pour from the facet, carrying
      her truth: being authentically yourself gives others permission to do
      the same.

      "It's not proper," Maya said out loud. "But it's true." She danced—
      every wild beautiful authentic part of herself flowing toward the facet.
      For one breathless moment, nothing happened. Then—color exploded where
      she touched crystal. Not just one color but every color she'd ever loved,
      blazing like fireworks. Cracks sealed themselves with sounds like laughter
      and music. Golden threads poured out, carrying the message: be yourself.
