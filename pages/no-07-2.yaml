      Noah holds the compass over the pool, hoping its light will clear the shadows. The compass
      glows brilliantly but the water's reflections grow darker, more chaotic—his fears multiply
      instead of disappearing. Noah's expression shifts from hope to frustration to rising panic.
      His confidence wavers. The shadows in the water seem to whisper: "you're not ready, you
      don't know the way, you'll choose wrong."

      The compass blazed with light, but the shadows only grew stronger. Noah's breath quickened.
      "Why isn't it working?" His old friend, doubt, crept back in. Maybe he couldn't do this after all.

      Noah sinks to the ground beside the pool, exhausted and discouraged. The sun is setting now,
      painting the grove in amber and shadow. His compass dims slightly—still glowing but softer,
      as if waiting. Noah hugs his knees, looking lost. In the distance, beyond the grove, he can
      see a cliff edge where the land drops away to open sky. The compass needle points that way—
      one more journey ahead. But Noah feels spent.

      Noah slumped beside the pool as shadows lengthened. The compass pointed onward—toward a
      cliff he could barely see. "I don't know if I can," he whispered. The grove offered no answer,
      only silence.
