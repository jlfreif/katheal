## Story

### Spread 1: el-01.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Ordinary world + desire hint

#### Description

Elise draws quietly in her room, noticing that one of her drawings seems to shimmer with a light that doesn't come from her lamp.

#### Page 5 (Left) - Character in their ordinary world

**Visual:**
Elise sits at a small desk by her window, hunched forward over a drawing. Her
right hand holds a golden-yellow colored pencil hovering above the paper. Several
pencils scatter across the desk near an open box of art supplies. Her expression
is peaceful and absorbed in creative flow. Drawings cover the wall behind her.

**Text:**
Elise drew a forest with a winding path and flowers that looked like they held
secrets. She loved imagining quiet places where magic might hide. Her colored
pencils moved slowly, carefully, the way she did everything. Outside her window,
the afternoon light was ordinary, but on her page, she was making something that
felt alive.

#### Page 6 (Right) - First hint of something different

**Visual:**
Elise's head tilts slightly, eyes widening with curiosity. On her paper, one
small flower she just finished glows with soft golden light that doesn't match
the lamp. The flower pulses gently, as if breathing. Her pencil hovers frozen
above the page. Afternoon light streams through the window behind her.

**Text:**
The flower on her paper started to glow. Elise blinked, but the light didn't
disappear. It pulsed softly, like a tiny heartbeat, warm and golden in a way
that had nothing to do with her lamp. Her pencil hung still in the air. She
leaned closer, watching the impossible light breathe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 2: el-02.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Inciting incident

#### Description

Elise touches the glowing drawing and finds herself pulled into Kathaél, where colors are fading and need someone who truly sees.

#### Page 7 (Left) - Discovery of the problem

**Visual:**
Elise stands between worlds, her fingertips touching a shimmering portal where
her drawing transformed into a doorway of light. One foot lifts as she's gently
pulled forward. Through the portal, a meadow appears with faded colors, flowers
washed out like sun-bleached watercolors. A luminescent butterfly rests on her
shoulder.

**Text:**
When Elise touched the glowing flower, the paper opened like a door. Through
it she saw a meadow, but something was wrong. The colors looked tired, like
crayons left too long in the sun. Pink flowers that should have been bright
were barely more than grey. Behind her, her bedroom faded to a whisper.

#### Page 8 (Right) - Decision to act

**Visual:**
Elise steps fully into Kathaél, standing in the faded meadow. Her ordinary
bedroom has become translucent behind her. Golden threads from the Heart Crystal
reach toward her, thin and dim. Her watercolor set hangs from her wrist. Her
expression shows wonder and gentle concern as she surveys the colorless landscape.

**Text:**
Elise stepped through, and her room dissolved like morning mist. The meadow
stretched around her, beautiful in shape but heartbreaking in color. Golden
threads drifted overhead, faint as old cobwebs. She understood without being
told: this world was losing something precious, and it had called to her. Maybe
because she noticed things others missed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 3: el-ma-03.yaml (joint with MA)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)

#### Description

Maya and Elise discover each other in a fading meadow, both trying obvious solutions that don't work. The cousins recognize each other with joy and surprise.

#### Page 9 (Left) - Trying the obvious solution

**Visual:**
Maya leaps and spins in the center of a faded meadow, her movements bold
and energetic. She wears her signature pink-streaked hair flying as she
dances, trying to bring life back through movement. Grey flowers surround
her, unresponsive. In the distance, a figure with paint-stained hands
kneels among the flowers.

**Text:**
Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like
wind itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life. Her
feet pounded the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely
stirred. She landed hard, breathing fast, and spun again. Nothing. In
the distance, someone knelt among the grey blooms, moving carefully.

#### Page 10 (Right) - Realizing it doesn't work

**Visual:**
Elise sits back on her heels, paintbrush lowering, as Maya bounds over.
Both girls freeze mid-motion as recognition hits. Maya's expression shifts
from determined to shocked to delighted. Elise's eyes widen with surprise
and joy. Grey flowers surround them. Golden threads pulse overhead, connecting
their presence.

**Text:**
"Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop, dust flying. Her cousin looked up from
her painting, eyes going wide. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright
and startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said
at exactly the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if
recognizing their connection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 4: el-no-04.yaml (joint with NO)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #2 (ask the expert)

#### Description

Noah and Elise cross paths at a luminous crossroads where the Heart Crystal's threads converge, discovering they're both trying to help and neither has all the answers.

#### Page 11 (Left) - Seeking guidance

**Visual:**
A crossroads beneath an ancient willow where forest paths meet. Golden threads
flow through the branches, some frayed and flickering. Noah stands on the left
path, notebook tucked under his arm, reaching toward a thread. In the distance,
the Heart Crystal pulses weakly, more threads drifting loose.

**Text:**
"I've tried everything." Noah followed the threads to a crossroads beneath
an ancient willow, hoping someone here might know what he was missing. The
Crystal glowed through the trees, dimmer than before, more threads
unraveling. He reached toward one, and it hummed warmly. But the path it
suggested led deeper into unfamiliar territory.

#### Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction with warning

**Visual:**
Elise stands on the right path, watercolor set at her wrist, observing a
different thread. Between the children, threads flow and intersect, creating
a lattice of golden light. Both turn toward each other, curious. The willow's
branches glow brighter where their paths nearly touch.

**Text:**
Noah spotted her at the same moment she spotted him. A girl with paint-stained
fingers, reaching for the threads just like he was. "Are you trying to help
them too?" he called. She nodded. "They keep rejecting everything I try."
"Same." Something warm spread through his chest. He wasn't alone in this.
The threads between them pulsed brighter and felt warm, like sunshine on skin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 5: el-05.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)

#### Description

Elise meets a dazzling artist-spirit who insists that bold, loud colors are the answer, but the approach feels wrong to her gentle nature.

#### Page 13 (Left) - Entering unfamiliar territory

**Visual:**
Elise stands at the edge of a circular plaza where the fading is severe. Trees
that should shimmer are nearly grey, the ground dull and lifeless. Her watercolor
set hangs from her wrist as she surveys the damaged landscape. Golden threads
overhead are barely visible, thin as spider silk. Her posture shows quiet concern.

**Text:**
The plaza looked worse than anywhere else. Trees stood grey as pencil sketches,
their shimmer completely gone. The ground, which should have glowed, was as
dull as pavement. Elise clutched her watercolor set to her chest, her heart
sinking. If her gentle approach couldn't help a single flower, how could she
possibly restore all of this?

#### Page 14 (Right) - Encountering misleading help

**Visual:**
A dramatic figure draped in clashing scarves of electric purple, harsh orange,
and screaming pink gestures wildly with giant paint-dripping brushes. Behind
the spirit, trees have been "restored" with garish, unnatural colors that clash
with each other. Elise takes a small step backward, one hand raised, her
expression showing polite uncertainty.

**Text:**
"Bold!" The artist-spirit swept enormous brushes through the air, splattering
neon colors everywhere. "Loud! That's how you fix fading!" Elise looked at
the trees the spirit had painted: harsh orange, electric purple, colors that
hurt to see. The watching animals had fled. Something in Elise's chest pulled
tight. This felt wrong. Very wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 6: el-06.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Midpoint: new insight / pattern

#### Description

Elise sits quietly and notices that colors return not through force, but through patient attention and caring presence.

#### Page 15 (Left) - Recognizing what doesn't work

**Visual:**
Elise sits cross-legged on soft moss in a small clearing, having left behind
the artist-spirit. Her watercolor set rests open but unused beside her. Both
hands rest gently in her lap, palms up. The garish painted trees are visible
in the distance behind her, a reminder of what doesn't work. Soft dawn light
filters through the trees.

**Text:**
Elise found a quiet clearing and sat down, her racing heart finally slowing.
The spirit's loud colors hadn't helped. Her own painting hadn't helped. She
was tired of trying so hard. Maybe the answer wasn't doing more. Maybe it
was something else entirely.

#### Page 16 (Right) - Discovering a new pattern

**Visual:**
Elise's hands cup gently around a single faded flower, not painting it but
holding space around it with tender attention. The flower slowly regains color,
grey fading to pale lavender to soft purple. Golden threads drift closer,
glowing brighter. A rabbit watches with approval. Luminescent pollen drifts
through the air.

**Text:**
Without thinking, Elise cupped her hands around a tiny grey flower, the way
she might hold something fragile and precious. She didn't paint. She just
noticed. Slowly, impossibly, color bloomed from the flower's center. Grey to
lavender to purple, spreading petal by petal. Her breath caught. The flower
didn't need fixing. It needed someone to truly see it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 7: el-07.yaml
**Node Type:** Mirrored Node | **Beat:** Rising stakes: almost works

#### Description

Elise's patient attention restores flowers one by one, but the endless scale of the fading threatens to overwhelm her.

#### Page 17 (Left) - Making progress toward goal

**Visual:**
Elise kneels in a meadow, hands cupped around a flower that glows with
restored color. Around her, a small circle of healed blooms creates an
island of beauty. A lantern hangs from a crooked post nearby, its flame
burning steady. Her expression shows peaceful focus. This is working.

**Text:**
Flower by flower, Elise brought color back. She cupped each bloom with
patient attention, and one by one they remembered their beauty. The
lantern nearby burned steady, its flame matching her calm focus. She'd
found the answer. This was working.

#### Page 18 (Right) - Realizing something is missing

**Visual:**
Elise stands and looks up from her small circle of restored flowers.
The meadow stretches endlessly in every direction, thousands of grey
flowers fading into the horizon. The lantern flame wavers as doubt
creeps in. Her shoulders sag slightly. One flower at a time against
all of this.

**Text:**
Then Elise stood and looked up. The meadow stretched forever. Thousands
of grey flowers, tens of thousands, more than she could ever reach. The
lantern flame wavered as her heart sank. Her way worked, but it was so
slow. How could attention to one flower matter against all this grey?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 8: el-08.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** All-is-lost / emotional low

#### Description

Elise faces a vast garden where everything has faded to grey, and she doubts her small, gentle approach can make any difference.

#### Page 19 (Left) - External obstacles intensify

**Visual:**
Elise stands at the edge of an enormous garden stretching to the horizon,
thousands of flowers, bushes, and trees all drained of color, rendered in
shades of grey and pale ash. Elegant paths wind through colorless flowerbeds.
A fountain flows with grey water in the distance. The sky above is overcast
and heavy. The scale is overwhelming.

**Text:**
The garden stretched forever. Thousands of flowers, all grey. Trees that
should have shimmered stood like pencil sketches waiting for color that would
never come. Elise's careful, gentle approach had restored a few blooms. A
few. Looking at this vast emptiness, those few felt like nothing at all.

#### Page 20 (Right) - Inner doubt and discouragement

**Visual:**
Elise stands very still, arms wrapped around herself in a self-protective hug,
chin tucked down. Her watercolor set lies fallen on the ground beside her feet.
Tears glisten on her cheeks, quiet crying showing deep sadness. In the near
foreground, one small flower retains a hint of color, but she hasn't noticed it.

**Text:**
Elise wrapped her arms around herself, trying to hold the pieces together.
Tears slid down her cheeks, quiet and unstoppable. She was too small. Too
gentle. Too slow. How could one nine-year-old who just noticed things possibly
matter against all this grey? Her watercolor set lay forgotten at her feet,
its colors seeming foolish now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 9: el-09.yaml
**Node Type:** Resonant Node | **Beat:** Deepening choice / inner shift

#### Description

Elise notices a single restored flower still glowing, chooses to continue—and feels an unexpected warmth ripple through the meadow.

#### Page 21 (Left) - Making the choice to continue

**Visual:**
Elise kneels beside a single glowing flower in the grey meadow, her
earlier work still holding its color. Her watercolor set lies open
beside her, but she's not painting—she's simply looking at the one
flower she helped. Her expression shifts from despair to something
softer. One flower mattered.

**Text:**
Through her tears, Elise saw one flower still glowing. Just one, from
her earlier work, holding its color against all the grey. It was tiny.
It was almost nothing. But it was real. She picked up her watercolor
set. If one flower could matter, then the next one could too.

#### Page 22 (Right) - Feeling the connection

**Visual:**
Golden threads shimmer into visibility across the meadow, pulsing
with warm light. Elise looks up, wonder on her face, as she feels
something like encouragement wash over her. Near her feet, a flower
begins to restore its color without her touching it. The grey seems
less heavy.

**Text:**
Golden light rippled through the air, threads she'd never seen before,
connecting the whole meadow. Elise felt warmth spread through her chest,
like someone somewhere was choosing the same courage she was. A flower
near her feet began to glow—without her even touching it. She wasn't
doing this alone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 10: el-10.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Climax: big action

#### Description

Elise reaches the Heart Crystal's center and faces the choice to offer her own gentle light, fearing it might not be bright enough.

#### Page 23 (Left) - Facing the final challenge

**Visual:**
Elise stands at the Heart Crystal's nexus, hundreds of faded golden threads
converging around her. She stands quietly, hands at her sides with palms
facing outward in an open, offering gesture. Inside her chest, visible through
a soft transparency, a gentle light glows like candlelight. Her eyes are closed
as if gathering courage.

**Text:**
The Heart Crystal's center surrounded her, threads converging from every direction.
Inside her chest, Elise felt her light: small and soft, like a candle, not
a bonfire. She could almost hear herself thinking: it's not enough. But the
threads leaned toward her hopefully. They seemed to be waiting for exactly
what she carried.

#### Page 24 (Right) - Taking decisive action

**Visual:**
Elise extends her hands outward, palms up, as soft light spreads from her
chest into the waiting threads. Her expression shows fear and determination
mixed together, jaw trembling but stance holding steady. Around her, creatures
of Kathaél have gathered in a circle, watching. The dim threads begin to
brighten with gentle color.

**Text:**
Elise opened her hands. She let her small, gentle light spread outward,
expecting it to disappear like a candle in wind. Instead, the threads caught
it. Passed it along. Her light touched one thread, which brightened, which
touched another. Color spread like ripples in still water. Her light was
exactly enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 11: el-11.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Resolution (external)

#### Description

Elise releases her light into the Heart Crystal, and colors bloom across Kathaél in gentle, natural waves. She receives a token of her gift.

#### Page 25 (Left) - Goal achieved, external reward

**Visual:**
The Heart Crystal's threads glow warmly, flowing through its facets with soft
watercolor washes of lavender, rose, sage, and amber. Elise stands with both
hands raised to chest height, and resting across her palms is a small, perfect
paintbrush made of light and golden thread. Her expression shows quiet wonder
and shy joy. Flowers bloom in soft hues around her.

**Text:**
Color spread through Kathaél like watercolor on wet paper, gentle and alive.
The threads glowed with soft hues: lavender, rose, sage, sky blue. Elise
watched her small light become something vast and beautiful. Then warmth
gathered in her palms, forming into a paintbrush of starlight. A gift. Proof
that noticing mattered.

#### Page 26 (Right) - Beginning the return

**Visual:**
Elise walks along a path lined with flowers in full, gentle color. The
starlight paintbrush is tucked carefully into her pocket. Creatures of
Kathaél watch her go: a rabbit hopping in a small circle, birds singing
softly, a deer bowing its head. In the distance, her ordinary world glows
warmly between the trees.

**Text:**
Elise tucked the paintbrush into her pocket, where it hummed with soft warmth.
The path home was lined with flowers that hadn't been there before, blooming
in colors she had helped remember. A rabbit hopped beside her for a few steps.
A deer bowed its head as she passed. Even leaving, she felt like she belonged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 12: el-12.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Resolution (emotional) + series button

#### Description

Elise returns to her room and her drawing, but now she sees the light in everything she creates—knowing her gentle attention matters.

#### Page 27 (Left) - Returning to ordinary world

**Visual:**
Elise sits at her small desk in the same position as the opening, drawing
with focused joy. The colored pencil in her hand carries a faint shimmer.
Her watercolor set sits open on the desk, one paintbrush glowing subtly with
golden light. Her expression is peaceful and content, posture relaxed and
confident in a new way.

**Text:**
Elise's room looked exactly the same: desk by the window, drawings on the
wall, art supplies scattered in their familiar mess. But when she picked up
her colored pencils, she felt the starlight paintbrush humming in her pocket.
She began to draw, and this time, she drew differently.

#### Page 28 (Right) - Transformed by the journey

**Visual:**
Elise's drawing shows a meadow full of flowers in gentle, beautiful colors,
and every flower on the page glows softly with its own light. On the wall
behind her, her other drawings have begun to show the same subtle glow.
Outside, a butterfly with faintly luminescent wings rests on the windowsill,
watching her draw.

**Text:**
Every flower she drew seemed to glow, just a little. Not magic. Just attention.
Elise noticed every color, every shadow, every small thing that mattered.
Outside her window, an ordinary butterfly sat on the sill, its wings catching
light in a way that might have been magical. Elise smiled. Her gentle way of
seeing was exactly enough.

### Meeting Node with Maya (MA)

#### Before (from Maya's story)

##### Spread 2: ma-02.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Inciting incident

###### Description

Maya touches the glowing dancer and finds herself pulled into Kathaél, where performances and dances are frozen mid-movement.

###### Page 7 (Left) - Discovery of the problem

**Visual:**
Maya stands between worlds, her paint-stained fingers touching a shimmering
portal where her painting transformed into a doorway. Through it, she sees
a meadow with frozen dancers—shadow figures stuck mid-leap, mid-spin,
unable to complete their movements. Golden threads connect them but flicker
weakly. Her athletic build is poised on tiptoes, ready to leap through.

**Text:**
When Maya touched the glowing dancer, the painting opened like a door.
Through it she saw a meadow filled with frozen performances—dancers
stuck mid-leap, musicians silent with instruments raised, performers
captured in moments that should have flowed into the next. Golden threads
connected them all, flickering like candles about to die. Something was
very wrong.

###### Page 8 (Right) - Decision to act

**Visual:**
Maya steps fully into Kathaél, standing in the meadow of frozen performances.
Her Madrid bedroom fades to translucent behind her. She spins once,
testing the space, and frozen dancers seem to lean toward her motion.
Golden threads from the Heart Crystal drift closer. Her expression shows
bold determination mixed with excited curiosity.

**Text:**
Maya stepped through, and her bedroom dissolved like watercolor in rain.
The meadow surrounded her, silent where it should have been full of music
and movement. She spun experimentally, and the frozen dancers seemed to
sway toward her, yearning. "You need someone to help you finish," Maya
understood. She grinned, bold and ready. "Perfect. I love a challenge."

#### Shared/Connected Page

##### Spread 3: el-ma-03.yaml (joint with MA)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)

###### Description

Maya and Elise discover each other in a fading meadow, both trying obvious solutions that don't work. The cousins recognize each other with joy and surprise.

###### Page 9 (Left) - Trying the obvious solution

**Visual:**
Maya leaps and spins in the center of a faded meadow, her movements bold
and energetic. She wears her signature pink-streaked hair flying as she
dances, trying to bring life back through movement. Grey flowers surround
her, unresponsive. In the distance, a figure with paint-stained hands
kneels among the flowers.

**Text:**
Maya leaped high, arms stretched wide, spinning through the meadow like
wind itself. If colors were fading, she'd dance them back to life. Her
feet pounded the earth in rhythm, bold and decisive. The flowers barely
stirred. She landed hard, breathing fast, and spun again. Nothing. In
the distance, someone knelt among the grey blooms, moving carefully.

###### Page 10 (Right) - Realizing it doesn't work

**Visual:**
Elise sits back on her heels, paintbrush lowering, as Maya bounds over.
Both girls freeze mid-motion as recognition hits. Maya's expression shifts
from determined to shocked to delighted. Elise's eyes widen with surprise
and joy. Grey flowers surround them. Golden threads pulse overhead, connecting
their presence.

**Text:**
"Elise?" Maya skidded to a stop, dust flying. Her cousin looked up from
her painting, eyes going wide. "Maya?!" They stared at each other for
one breathless second. Then both burst out laughing, the sound bright
and startled in the grey meadow. "What are YOU doing here?" they said
at exactly the same time. The threads overhead pulsed warmer, as if
recognizing their connection.

#### After (from Maya's story)

##### Spread 4: ma-04.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Attempt #2 (ask the expert)

###### Description

Maya searches for guidance on the proper technique to restore the frozen performances.

###### Page 11 (Left) - Seeking guidance

**Visual:**
Maya follows golden threads through the forest, dancing as she goes—
little leaps and spins. The threads lead her toward a performance
pavilion where multiple paths meet. She moves with natural athleticism,
her pink-streaked hair bouncing. Her expression shows confident
determination mixed with slight uncertainty about what comes next.

**Text:**
Maya danced along the thread-paths, hoping they'd lead to someone who
knew the secret. There must be a right way to perform, a proper technique
she was missing. The threads led her to a pavilion where performance
paths crossed. "Someone here has to know the correct steps," she said,
bouncing on her toes.

###### Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction with warning

**Visual:**
Maya stands at the pavilion where performance paths diverge. The threads
pulse and point toward strange territory ahead—stages that shift shape,
audiences made of shadow, performances that follow no rules she recognizes.
A fox watches from nearby, its expression cautionary. Maya swallows but
sets her chin determinedly.

**Text:**
The threads pulsed and pointed ahead, toward performance spaces that
made no sense. Stages that changed shape. Dances with no choreography.
Songs with no melody. A fox met her eyes, and Maya felt the warning:
this would be harder than performing for her teachers or friends. "Okay,"
Maya said, rolling her shoulders. "I can be brave."

### Meeting Node with Noah (NO)

###### Description

Noah confidently tries to intellectually decode the stuck stories and write endings based on his analysis, but they reject every logically crafted conclusion he offers.

###### Page 9 (Left) - Trying the obvious solution

**Visual:**
Noah kneels beside a floating thread, notebook open, pen moving confidently.
Glowing letters appear in the air beside the frozen story-words. The thread
flickers, rejecting his ending, scattering his words like sparks. More failed
attempts litter the mossy ground around him.

**Text:**
"Okay, I can figure this out." Noah knelt beside the frozen story and uncapped
his pen. "She reached for the door and found her brother waiting." He analyzed
the pattern: reunion equals resolution. "Perfect!" Noah announced. The thread
trembled... then spat his words back at him like watermelon seeds. Letters
bounced off his forehead. "Ow! Okay, not perfect!"

###### Page 10 (Right) - Realizing it doesn't work

**Visual:**
Noah sits against a tree trunk, surrounded by fading letters from failed
endings bouncing off like rubber balls. His notebook shows crossed-out attempts.
The frozen story-thread hangs incomplete nearby, unmoved. A fox with knowing
eyes watches from the underbrush, looking almost amused.

**Text:**
Five more endings. Ten. Every single one dissolved or bounced back. Noah sat
back, puzzled. "Weird. Those were solid endings." The fox in the underbrush
chittered, and somehow Noah understood: Right for who? Noah tilted his head.
"You mean... the stories want something different?" The fox flicked its tail
and trotted deeper into the forest. Noah jumped up. "Wait, are you taking me
somewhere?"

path, notebook tucked under his arm, reaching toward a thread. In the distance,
the Heart Crystal pulses weakly, more threads drifting loose.

**Text:**
"I've tried everything." Noah followed the threads to a crossroads beneath
an ancient willow, hoping someone here might know what he was missing. The
Crystal glowed through the trees, dimmer than before, more threads
unraveling. He reached toward one, and it hummed warmly. But the path it
suggested led deeper into unfamiliar territory.

###### Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction with warning

Elise stands on the right path, watercolor set at her wrist, observing a
different thread. Between the children, threads flow and intersect, creating
a lattice of golden light. Both turn toward each other, curious. The willow's
branches glow brighter where their paths nearly touch.

**Text:**
Noah spotted her at the same moment she spotted him. A girl with paint-stained
fingers, reaching for the threads just like he was. "Are you trying to help
them too?" he called. She nodded. "They keep rejecting everything I try."
"Same." Something warm spread through his chest. He wasn't alone in this.

###### Description

Max and Noah meet in a vast clearing where hundreds of stories are frozen. Both discover they've been using similar analytical approaches that don't work.

###### Page 13 (Left) - Entering unfamiliar territory

**Visual:**
Max stands at the edge of a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads
hang suspended, all frayed and flickering. He holds a notebook filled with
diagrams and systems for solving the problem. His expression shows alarm at
the scale. In the distance, another figure with a notebook approaches, looking
equally overwhelmed.

**Text:**
The clearing stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen stories hung in
the air, all fraying at the edges. Max gripped his notebook tighter, systems
and diagrams filling every page. He'd tried organizing them by type, by
pattern, by structure. Nothing worked. The Crystal pulsed dimmer in the
distance. A flower nearby turned to dust. "This is really bad."

###### Page 14 (Right) - Encountering misleading help

**Visual:**
Max and Noah stand face to face, both holding notebooks covered in crossed-out
attempts. Behind them, a storyteller in a patched coat gestures wildly at
a flowchart, his formulaic approach causing a thread to smoke and knot.
Both boys step back simultaneously, recognizing their own mistakes in
the storyteller's methods.

**Text:**
"You want to help stories? I have the formula!" The storyteller lunged
forward, grabbing threads. "Twelve steps, perfectly predictable!" A thread
writhed and knotted, smoking. Max and another boy with sandy hair dove
forward at the same time. "Stop!" they shouted together. They looked at
each other, both breathing hard, both holding notebooks. The other boy's
eyes widened. "You've been trying to analyze them too?"
