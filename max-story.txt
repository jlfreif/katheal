## Story

### Spread 1: mx-01.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Ordinary world + desire hint

#### Description

Max practices free throws in his driveway, frustrated by a persistent mistake he can't seem to fix, until a golden thread appears.

#### Page 5 (Left) - Character in their ordinary world

**Visual:**
Max stands in his driveway shooting basketball free throws, his red
hair bright in afternoon sun. A basketball hoop hangs above the garage.
Around him, chalk marks on the pavement show failed attempts and
corrections. His trombone case leans against the garage door. His jaw
is set with determination, but frustration shows in his tense shoulders.

**Text:**
Clang. The ball bounced off the rim again. Max snatched it up and
reset his position, checking his feet, his grip, his elbow angle.
Everything should work. He'd analyzed every part. But shot after shot
clanged wrong. He threw harder, adjusted faster, tried again. Still
wrong. His hands clenched the ball. "Why do I keep missing?"

#### Page 6 (Right) - First hint of something different

**Visual:**
Max freezes mid-shot as a golden thread floats through the air, weaving
between the garage and the hoop. The thread pulses with urgent light,
one end frayed and flickering. The basketball hovers forgotten in his
hands as he stares. His expression shifts from frustration to curiosity.

**Text:**
A shimmer caught his eye. Golden thread drifted through the air, bright
and impossible, weaving past his basketball hoop. But something looked
wrong with it. The end flickered weakly, unraveling like a rope coming
apart. Max dropped the ball. It bounced away, forgotten. The thread
pulsed brighter, pulling gently toward the trees behind his house.
"What are you?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 2: mx-02.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Inciting incident

#### Description

Max follows the thread into Kathaél and discovers a world where courage fuels magic, but the Heart Crystal is cracking from abandoned attempts.

#### Page 7 (Left) - Discovery of the problem

**Visual:**
Max stands at the threshold between his backyard and a glowing forest,
gripping the golden thread. One foot on grass, one on luminous moss.
Challenge courses stretch between trees, their obstacles frozen mid-motion.
In the distance, the Heart Crystal rises, its facets cracked and dim.
His athletic build is poised for action.

**Text:**
The thread tugged Max forward, and he grabbed it. One step took him from
his driveway into a forest that glowed like someone painted it with light.
Challenge courses wound between trees, their obstacles frozen wrong, half-built.
The golden threads around them flickered weakly. A massive crystal structure
rose ahead, cracks spreading across its surface. Something here needed fixing.

#### Page 8 (Right) - Decision to act

**Visual:**
Max kneels beside a frozen challenge course, touching an obstacle that
should move but doesn't. Golden threads connected to it pulse weakly.
A fox with knowing eyes watches from nearby. The Heart Crystal glows
dimly in the background. Max's expression shows determination and
competitive focus kicking in.

**Text:**
Max knelt beside a frozen balance beam. It should have been moving, creating
a challenge, but it hung still and grey. He pushed it, and it creaked sadly.
The threads connected to it flickered like dying stars. A fox watched him
with ancient eyes, and somehow Max understood: these challenges had been
abandoned mid-attempt. "I don't quit," Max said, standing. "Let me help."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 3: mx-03.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Attempt #1 (simple/obvious)

#### Description

Max attacks frozen challenges with determination and perfect form, but forcing perfection makes them worse instead of better.

#### Page 9 (Left) - Trying the obvious solution

**Visual:**
Max runs through an obstacle course with intense focus, his form perfect
and controlled. He leaps barriers, balances on beams, climbs walls with
textbook technique. Behind him, the obstacles he completes turn grey
instead of glowing. His expression shows concentration and effort. He
hasn't noticed the problem yet.

**Text:**
Max attacked the first course with everything he had. Perfect form, no
mistakes, complete the challenge exactly right. He vaulted the first
obstacle cleanly, balanced across the second without wavering, climbed
the third with precise hand placement. Behind him, the obstacles he'd
completed turned grey and cold. He landed the final jump. "Done!"

#### Page 10 (Right) - Realizing it doesn't work

**Visual:**
Max stands breathing hard, looking back at the course he completed. Every
obstacle he touched has turned grey and lifeless. The golden threads
connected to them have gone dark. A rabbit watches with sympathetic eyes.
Max's confident expression crumbles to confusion and frustration.

**Text:**
Max turned back, grinning, ready for his next challenge. The grin died.
Every obstacle he'd completed perfectly was now grey as stone, threads
dark and dead. "No. No, I did it right!" He ran back, tried again,
faster this time, more perfect. More obstacles turned grey. The rabbit
twitched its nose. Wrong how? Max thought, frustrated. How can doing
it right be wrong?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 4: mx-04.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Attempt #2 (ask the expert)

#### Description

Max follows the threads to find an expert, hoping someone knows the correct technique he's missing.

#### Page 11 (Left) - Seeking guidance

**Visual:**
Max jogs through the forest following golden threads, notebook tucked
under his arm filled with technique notes. The threads lead him toward
a training ground where multiple paths converge. He scans the area
with competitive focus, looking for someone who might have answers.
His athletic stride shows confidence despite his earlier failures.

**Text:**
Max followed the strongest threads, hoping they'd lead to someone who
knew the right technique. He'd been approaching it wrong, clearly.
There must be a system, a method, a proper way to fix these challenges.
The threads led him to a training ground where paths crossed. "Someone
here has to know how this works."

#### Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction with warning

**Visual:**
Max stands at a crossroads where training paths meet. Golden threads
pulse and point toward unfamiliar territory ahead—a place where the
challenges look harder, weirder, nothing like the sports courses he
knows. A deer watches from the edge, its expression warning. Max
swallows but sets his jaw determinedly.

**Text:**
The threads pulsed and pointed ahead, toward training grounds that looked
nothing like basketball courts or track fields. Obstacles twisted in
impossible shapes, challenges that made no sense. A deer met his eyes,
and Max understood the message: this would be harder than anything he'd
tried. "Okay," Max said, rolling his shoulders. "I can handle hard."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 5: mx-no-05.yaml (joint with NO)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #3 (bigger world / stakes up)

#### Description

Max and Noah meet in a vast clearing where hundreds of stories are frozen. Both discover they've been using similar analytical approaches that don't work.

#### Page 13 (Left) - Entering unfamiliar territory

**Visual:**
Max stands at the edge of a vast clearing where hundreds of golden threads
hang suspended, all frayed and flickering. He holds a notebook filled with
diagrams and systems for solving the problem. His expression shows alarm at
the scale. In the distance, another figure with a notebook approaches, looking
equally overwhelmed.

**Text:**
The clearing stretched impossibly wide. Hundreds of frozen stories hung in
the air, all fraying at the edges. Max gripped his notebook tighter, systems
and diagrams filling every page. He'd tried organizing them by type, by
pattern, by structure. Nothing worked. The Crystal pulsed dimmer in the
distance. A flower nearby turned to dust. "This is really bad."

#### Page 14 (Right) - Encountering misleading help

**Visual:**
Max and Noah stand face to face, both holding notebooks covered in crossed-out
attempts. Behind them, a storyteller in a patched coat gestures wildly at
a flowchart, his formulaic approach causing a thread to smoke and knot.
Both boys step back simultaneously, recognizing their own mistakes in
the storyteller's methods.

**Text:**
"You want to help stories? I have the formula!" The storyteller lunged
forward, grabbing threads. "Twelve steps, perfectly predictable!" A thread
writhed and knotted, smoking. Max and another boy with sandy hair dove
forward at the same time. "Stop!" they shouted together. They looked at
each other, both breathing hard, both holding notebooks. The other boy's
eyes widened. "You've been trying to analyze them too?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 6: mx-06.yaml
**Node Type:** Mirrored Node | **Beat:** Midpoint: new insight / pattern

#### Description

Max exhausts himself trying to restart perfectly after each mistake, then discovers that continuing through mistakes is his true strength.

#### Page 15 (Left) - Recognizing what doesn't work

**Visual:**
Max slumps against a training post in a rocky clearing, chest heaving.
Around him, puzzle pieces from failed attempts scatter the ground. A
challenge course shifts and reshapes itself behind him. A compass hangs
from the post beside his head, its needle spinning wildly. His notebook
lies closed at his feet.

**Text:**
Max collapsed against the post, lungs burning. Every time he made a
mistake, he'd started over from the beginning. Perfectly. But the course
kept changing, and he kept failing, and he was so tired of restarting.
The compass beside him spun in frantic circles, pointing nowhere. He
closed his eyes. Maybe perfect wasn't the answer.

#### Page 16 (Right) - Discovering a new pattern

**Visual:**
Max stands before the challenge course, and instead of restarting after
a mistake, he keeps moving forward. Behind him, his footprints show a
messy path with corrections and stumbles, but all moving forward. The
compass's needle points steady and true directly at him. Golden threads
pulse approval.

**Text:**
Max stood and faced the course again. This time, when he stumbled on
the third obstacle, he didn't restart. He caught himself, adjusted,
and kept going. The course stopped shifting. The compass needle swung
around and pointed straight at him, steady as stone. "Oh," Max breathed.
"You don't want perfect. You want persistence."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 7: mx-07.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Rising stakes: almost works

#### Description

Max uses his new persistence-through-mistakes approach and restores several challenges, but when one goes really wrong, old habits return.

#### Page 17 (Left) - Making progress toward goal

**Visual:**
Max works through a challenge course, his form less perfect but his
movement continuous. When he stumbles, he corrects and keeps going.
Behind him, restored obstacles glow with golden light. A lantern burns
steady on a post nearby. His expression shows focused determination.
This is working.

**Text:**
Max ran the course again, but differently this time. When he stumbled
on a balance beam, he didn't restart. He caught himself, adjusted,
kept moving. The beam began to glow. He missed a handhold on the wall,
grabbed another, pulled himself up. The wall shimmered to life. The
lantern beside him burned steady. "Yes! It's working!"

#### Page 18 (Right) - Realizing something is missing

**Visual:**
Max stands frozen before a collapsed challenge—ropes tangled, structures
broken—a mistake so big it looks unfixable. His hands clench in
frustration. The lantern's flame sputters and dims. Behind him, his
restored challenges begin to grey again. His expression shows the old
habit of wanting to quit returning.

**Text:**
Then Max reached a challenge he'd completely destroyed earlier. Ropes
tangled, structure collapsed, broken beyond recognition. His hands
clenched. This wasn't a small mistake. This was massive failure. The
lantern beside him flickered and dimmed. His restored challenges behind
him began to grey. "I can't fix this," Max muttered, already stepping
back. "This is too broken."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 8: mx-08.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** All-is-lost / emotional low

#### Description

Max confronts a training ground destroyed by his earlier attempts, believing his mistakes have made things worse instead of better.

#### Page 19 (Left) - External obstacles intensify

**Visual:**
Max stands in a training ground littered with broken obstacles, twisted
metal, collapsed structures—all his earlier "perfect" attempts that
failed catastrophically. Rain begins to fall. The Heart Crystal in
the distance cracks with an audible sound. A challenge course nearby
crumbles to dust. His tall athletic frame looks small against the damage.

**Text:**
The training ground stretched before him, destroyed. Every challenge
he'd tried to complete perfectly lay in ruins—twisted metal, broken
beams, courses that would never work again. Rain started falling, cold
and heavy. The Crystal cracked louder. A nearby course collapsed to
dust. "I thought I could fix this," Max whispered. "I just made
everything worse."

#### Page 20 (Right) - Inner doubt and discouragement

**Visual:**
Max sits slumped against a fallen obstacle, rain soaking his red hair,
notebook abandoned beside him with pages smeared. His arms rest on his
knees, head down. A small bird lands on the wreckage nearby, not singing,
just present. One weak golden thread still glows faintly in the debris.

**Text:**
Max sank down against the wreckage, rain streaming down his face. His
notebook lay beside him, all his systems and techniques smeared into
illegible ink. He'd tried so hard. Analyzed everything. Kept going
through small mistakes. But these big mistakes? The bird above didn't
move. Just stayed. Max noticed the thread still glowing weakly in the
debris. Even ruined, it hadn't completely died.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 9: mx-09.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Deepening choice / inner shift

#### Description

Max decides to attempt fixing the broken challenge not despite his big mistake, but through it—using the wreckage as raw material for something new.

#### Page 21 (Left) - Making the choice to continue

**Visual:**
Max stands, rain-soaked, and walks back toward the destroyed challenge.
He picks up a broken piece of metal, testing its weight. His posture
shows determination mixed with uncertainty. The bird from before watches
with approval. His notebook lies closed on the ground—he's not following
a system anymore.

**Text:**
Max stood. He didn't know how to fix this. Didn't have a system or
technique. But the thread was still there, weak but alive. He walked
back to the wreckage and picked up a broken beam. Maybe he couldn't
restore what was. But maybe he could build something new from the
mistake. "Okay," he said to the wreckage. "Let's try."

#### Page 22 (Right) - Discovering the missed clue

**Visual:**
Max works with the broken pieces, not trying to rebuild the original
perfectly but creating something new from the ruins. As he connects
pieces, golden threads weave between them, stronger than before. A
warmth spreads through the air—someone else's courage reaching him.
The challenge begins glowing, different but alive.

**Text:**
Max pieced together broken beams, twisted metal, collapsed ropes—not
rebuilding what was, but making something new. The threads wove between
his hands, humming. Warmth flooded through him, bright and unexpected,
like someone far away was being brave at the exact same moment. The
challenge glowed to life, different from the original but stronger.
"Mistakes don't have to be endings," Max breathed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 10: mx-10.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Climax: big action

#### Description

Max brings his rebuilt-from-mistakes challenge to the Heart Crystal, choosing to offer something imperfect but real.

#### Page 23 (Left) - Facing the final challenge

**Visual:**
Max stands at the Heart Crystal's base, hands pressed against the
challenge-facet. Through the clear surface, he can see other facets—
one glowing with stories, one shimmering with colors. His rebuilt
challenge hovers beside him, cobbled together and imperfect. Cracks
spread across the crystal. His jaw trembles with doubt.

**Text:**
Max stood at the Crystal's base, his rebuilt challenge hovering beside
him. It wasn't perfect. You could see where he'd messed up, where he'd
had to improvise, where mistakes became solutions. Through the crystal,
he saw other facets glowing stronger. His hands shook. "This isn't
good enough," he thought. But it was honest. It was his.

#### Page 24 (Right) - Taking decisive action

**Visual:**
Max pushes his imperfect challenge toward the Crystal facet. Light
blazes where they connect. The challenge transforms, its rough edges
becoming its strength. Cracks seal with musical sounds. Golden threads
pour from the facet, carrying the lesson: persistence through mistakes
creates strength that perfection never could.

**Text:**
"It's not perfect," Max said out loud. "But I didn't quit." He pushed
the challenge toward the facet. For one terrible moment, nothing happened.
Then—light exploded where they connected. The challenge's rough edges
blazed like a constellation. Cracks sealed themselves with sounds like
victory bells. Golden threads poured from the challenge-facet, stronger
than any perfect attempt could have made them. Persistence had won.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 11: mx-11.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Resolution (external)

#### Description

The Heart Crystal blazes with renewed strength, and Max receives a wristband that glows when he persists through difficulty.

#### Page 25 (Left) - Goal achieved, external reward

**Visual:**
The Heart Crystal blazes with light, every facet glowing strong. Max's
challenge weaves into the crystal structure, its imperfect form creating
new patterns. Between his hands materializes a simple wristband woven
from golden thread, glowing softly. The fox from earlier watches with
approval, tail swishing.

**Text:**
The Crystal blazed like a star, every facet strong again. Max's imperfect
challenge wove itself into the pattern, and somehow its rough edges made
the whole structure more resilient. Light gathered in his palms, warm
and solid, until a wristband appeared—simple, golden, pulsing gently.
The fox sat nearby, watching. Max grinned. "I really didn't quit."

#### Page 26 (Right) - Beginning the return

**Visual:**
Max walks along a glowing path toward home, the wristband warm on his
wrist. Around him, challenge courses complete themselves, incorporating
mistakes into their designs instead of erasing them. A rabbit hops
alongside him. His driveway with the basketball hoop glows warmly in
the distance between trees.

**Text:**
Max walked home, the wristband humming against his wrist. All around,
frozen challenges began moving again, their designs incorporating the
stumbles and adjustments that made them real. A rabbit hopped beside
him for a few steps, then darted away. "Thank you," Max called to the
forest. The basketball hoop in his driveway gleamed ahead, looking
somehow different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spread 12: mx-12.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Resolution (emotional) + series button

#### Description

Max returns to his driveway and the basketball challenge, but now he approaches mistakes with curiosity instead of frustration.

#### Page 27 (Left) - Returning to ordinary world

**Visual:**
Max stands in his driveway in the same position as the opening, basketball
in hand, same hoop above the garage. But the chalk marks on the pavement
now show a trail of adjustments leading to improvement, not just failures.
The wristband glows softly on his wrist. His trombone case still leans
against the garage. His expression is calm, curious.

**Text:**
Max's driveway looked the same: afternoon light, basketball hoop, chalk
marks on the pavement. But he didn't feel the same. He picked up the
basketball, set his position. The wristband hummed on his wrist. "Okay,"
he said to the hoop. "Let's see what this attempt shows me."

#### Page 28 (Right) - Transformed by the journey

**Visual:**
Max shoots. The ball clangs off the rim—but he grins instead of getting
frustrated. He adjusts his stance based on the miss and shoots again.
This shot swishes through. The wristband glows brighter. A golden thread
shimmers at the edge of his vision, unfinished and inviting. The bird
from Kathaél watches from a tree branch.

**Text:**
Clang. The ball bounced off the rim. Max grinned. "Too much force," he
muttered, adjusting. He shot again. Swish. The wristband glowed warm
against his skin. "Not about being perfect," he said, retrieving the
ball. "It's about figuring it out as you go." At the tree's edge, a
golden thread caught the light. The bird from Kathaél tilted its head.
Max waved. More adventures were definitely coming.

### Meeting Node with Noah (NO)

#### Before (from Noah's story)

##### Spread 4: el-no-04.yaml (joint with EL)
**Node Type:** Meeting Node | **Beat:** Attempt #2 (ask the expert)

###### Description

Noah and Elise cross paths at a luminous crossroads where the Heart Crystal's threads converge, discovering they're both trying to help and neither has all the answers.

###### Page 11 (Left) - Seeking guidance

**Visual:**
A crossroads beneath an ancient willow where forest paths meet. Golden threads
flow through the branches, some frayed and flickering. Noah stands on the left
path, notebook tucked under his arm, reaching toward a thread. In the distance,
the Heart Crystal pulses weakly, more threads drifting loose.

**Text:**
"I've tried everything." Noah followed the threads to a crossroads beneath
an ancient willow, hoping someone here might know what he was missing. The
Crystal glowed through the trees, dimmer than before, more threads
unraveling. He reached toward one, and it hummed warmly. But the path it
suggested led deeper into unfamiliar territory.

###### Page 12 (Right) - Receiving direction with warning

**Visual:**
Elise stands on the right path, watercolor set at her wrist, observing a
different thread. Between the children, threads flow and intersect, creating
a lattice of golden light. Both turn toward each other, curious. The willow's
branches glow brighter where their paths nearly touch.

**Text:**
Noah spotted her at the same moment she spotted him. A girl with paint-stained
fingers, reaching for the threads just like he was. "Are you trying to help
them too?" he called. She nodded. "They keep rejecting everything I try."
"Same." Something warm spread through his chest. He wasn't alone in this.
The threads between them pulsed brighter and felt warm, like sunshine on skin.

#### After (from Noah's story)

##### Spread 6: no-06.yaml
**Node Type:** Solo | **Beat:** Midpoint: new insight / pattern

###### Description

Noah stops trying to analyze and understand everything and discovers that stories complete themselves when someone is simply present and honest with them.

###### Page 15 (Left) - Recognizing what doesn't work

**Visual:**
Noah sits on a moss-covered boulder, notebook closed beside him, hands empty.
Story-threads hang frozen around him. The storyteller's tangled mess glows
dimly in the distance. Noah's posture shows exhaustion giving way to stillness.

**Text:**
Noah collapsed onto the moss-covered boulder, completely exhausted. His notebook
slipped from his fingers. He was too tired to pick it up. Too tired to plan.
Too tired to fix anything. For the first time, he just... stopped. No pen. No plan.
Just him, being honest about not understanding.

###### Page 16 (Right) - Discovering a new pattern

**Visual:**
A golden thread hovers before Noah, and as he watches without interfering,
words begin forming at its trailing end, writing themselves in soft light.
His eyes widen with understanding. A deer watches from the grove's edge.
The completed thread glows brighter than any he's seen.

**Text:**
The thread in front of him trembled. Then, impossibly, words began writing
themselves: "...and she realized home had been there all along." The thread
sealed itself, glowing bright and whole. Noah's breath caught. He sat up slowly,
afraid to scare it. The thread glowed brighter and brighter until it was almost
too beautiful to look at. "You did it yourself," he whispered. "You just needed..."
He trailed off, understanding flooding through him. "You needed someone to stick
around. Someone to witness it."
