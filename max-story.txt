================================================================================
SPREAD 1: ORDINARY WORLD + DESIRE HINT
================================================================================

Page 5 (Left) - Character in Their Ordinary World
--------------------------------------------------

Max bounced the basketball, grinning. Swish. He caught it, spun, shot from the
free throw line. Swish again. "And the crowd goes wild!" He did a quick mime
routine, pretending to sign autographs. The afternoon sun felt good. Everything
felt good. He loved this—the rhythm, the challenge, figuring out the perfect
angle for each shot.


Page 6 (Right) - First Hint of Something Different
---------------------------------------------------

A golden thread drifted past the hoop. Max caught it mid-dribble, ball
forgotten. The thread pulsed bright, but its edges flickered and frayed. It
tugged toward the woods, urgent and alive. Max tilted his head. "Okay, that's
new." He pocketed the ball and followed, jogging easily. "Not the weirdest thing
that's happened this week. But close." Something about the thread felt
important. Like a puzzle waiting to be solved.


================================================================================
SPREAD 2: INCITING INCIDENT
================================================================================

Page 7 (Left) - Discovery of the Problem
-----------------------------------------

One step took Max from his backyard into a forest that glowed. Obstacle courses
stretched between enormous trees—rope bridges, climbing walls, balance beams,
all woven with golden threads. But half the courses hung broken, threads dark
and lifeless. In the distance, a massive crystal structure pulsed weakly,
cracks spreading across its surface. "Whoa," Max breathed. "This is Kathaél."
He'd heard the name whispered by the threads.


Page 8 (Right) - Decision to Act
---------------------------------

A fox sat beside the nearest course, watching him with ancient eyes. Max
understood somehow: the courses powered the crystal. The crystal powered
everything. And everything was failing. The fox's gaze moved to Max, then to
the broken course, then back. "You want me to fix it?" Max asked. The fox
didn't move. Max cracked his knuckles. "Okay. I'm good at challenges. Let's do
this."


================================================================================
SPREAD 3: ATTEMPT #1 (SIMPLE/OBVIOUS)
================================================================================

Page 9 (Left) - Trying the Obvious Solution
--------------------------------------------

Max approached the first course like a basketball drill. Sprint to the rope
swing. Jump. Grab. Swing across. He landed clean, rolled, came up running. The
balance beam wobbled, but he'd done worse in gym class. He kept his weight
centered, arms out. Three obstacles down. The threads around him flickered
faintly. "Easy," he muttered, grinning.


Page 10 (Right) - Realizing It Doesn't Work
--------------------------------------------

Then he hit the wall. Literally. A climbing section that shifted as he touched
it, handholds rotating away. He grabbed for one and it spun backward. He fell,
landed hard on his shoulder. The entire course flickered and went dark.
Everything he'd completed reset to broken. "What?" Max stood, rubbing his
shoulder. "I was doing it right! This is some next-level difficulty setting."
The fox just watched. This was going to be harder than he thought.


================================================================================
SPREAD 4: ATTEMPT #2 (ASK THE EXPERT)
================================================================================

Page 11 (Left) - Seeking Guidance
----------------------------------

Max circled the course, studying it. There had to be a pattern. He was good at
patterns. The handholds rotated in sequence—three clicks left, two clicks
right, one click left. He could time it. He pulled out his phone, started
recording notes. Math this out. Solve the puzzle before trying the physical
challenge.


Page 12 (Right) - Receiving Direction with Warning
---------------------------------------------------

Max ran the course again, timing every move. He made it past the rotating wall.
Yes! Then the course shifted. New obstacles appeared. The balance beam split
into three paths. The rope swing moved. "Oh, come ON!" Max shouted. The course
wasn't just hard. It was adaptive. It learned. The fox's tail swished once.
This would take more than timing.


================================================================================
SPREAD 5: ATTEMPT #3 (BIGGER WORLD / STAKES UP) - Meeting Noah
================================================================================

Page 13 (Left) - Entering Unfamiliar Territory
-----------------------------------------------

Max followed a golden thread deeper into Kathaél. More courses stretched in
every direction, all broken, all dark. The Heart Crystal loomed ahead, bigger
than he'd realized, cracks spreading like spiderwebs. A flower nearby withered
to dust. The air felt wrong. Max's stomach tightened. This wasn't just about
one course. This was everything.


Page 14 (Right) - Encountering Family
--------------------------------------

"Max?" A familiar voice. Max spun. Noah stood there, sandy hair messy, looking
as surprised as Max felt. "Noah?! What are YOU doing here?" They stared at each
other. Cousins meeting in an impossible magical forest. "I'm trying to fix
these courses," Noah said. Max pointed at his own broken course. "Same. This is
way harder than it looks." Noah grinned. "Want to compare notes?"


================================================================================
SPREAD 6: MIDPOINT - NEW INSIGHT / PATTERN
================================================================================

Page 15 (Left) - Recognizing What Doesn't Work
-----------------------------------------------

Max and Noah tackled a course together. Max handled the physical obstacles
while Noah called out patterns he'd spotted. They worked in rhythm—Max jumping,
Noah directing. "Left! No, wait, right!" They almost had it. Then the course
shifted again. They both fell. Max groaned. "It keeps CHANGING!" Noah frowned
at his notes. "Unless... what if changing is the point?"


Page 16 (Right) - Discovering a New Pattern
--------------------------------------------

Max stood. "Say that again." Noah's eyes lit up. "What if the course changes
because we're supposed to adapt? Not solve it once, but keep adjusting?" Max
tested it. He ran the course, and when obstacles shifted, he shifted too.
Adjusted mid-jump. Changed direction mid-climb. The threads hummed. The course
stayed active. "That's it!" Max laughed. "It's not about being perfect. It's
about not giving up when things change!"


================================================================================
SPREAD 7: RISING STAKES - ACTION SCENE - Meeting Maya
================================================================================

Page 17 (Left) - Fun Action Scene with Creature
------------------------------------------------

A creature made of vines and golden light blocked the path to the next course.
It moved fast, whip-quick tendrils snapping toward Max. "Okay, so we're doing
this?" Max dropped into a defensive stance, basketball instincts kicking in. He
dodged left, ducked right, rolled under a sweeping vine. His heart pounded.
This was the most fun he'd had all day.


Page 18 (Right) - Victory But Tired
------------------------------------

Max spotted the pattern—the creature telegraphed its moves, like a defensive
player. He faked left, went right, and touched the crystal at the creature's
center. It dissolved into light, peaceful. A girl with dark curly hair stood
behind where the creature had been. "Nice moves!" Maya said, grinning. "I'm
Maya. Also trying to save this place." Max caught his breath. "Max. And that
was exhausting." But he'd done it.


================================================================================
SPREAD 8: ALL-IS-LOST / EMOTIONAL LOW
================================================================================

Page 19 (Left) - External Obstacles Intensify
----------------------------------------------

The central course rose before them: massive, complex, impossible. Ten
obstacles woven together, each requiring perfect timing. Max tried. He made it
through three obstacles before the fourth shifted and he fell. He tried again.
Fell at obstacle six. Again. Again. His legs shook. His hands were raw. The
course hummed, indifferent to his effort.


Page 20 (Right) - Natural Frustration
--------------------------------------

Max sat on the ground, breathing hard. Maya offered water. "This is
ridiculous," he muttered. "I've tried everything. It's just too hard." Maya
sat beside him. "Maybe it's supposed to be." Max looked up. The fox was there
again, patient. Watching. Max wiped sweat from his face and stared at the
course. Wait. There. The way the obstacles moved. They weren't random. They
were showing him something.


================================================================================
SPREAD 9: DEEPENING CHOICE / INNER SHIFT
================================================================================

Page 21 (Left) - Making the Choice to Continue
-----------------------------------------------

Max stood. His legs protested, but he ignored them. "Okay," he said, rolling
his shoulders. "Take forty-seven. Let's do this." Maya raised an eyebrow.
"Forty-seven?" Max grinned. "Persistence is my thing." He approached the
course. This time, he watched the rhythm like a basketball game. Everything had
timing. Everything had flow.


Page 22 (Right) - New Approach Works
-------------------------------------

Max moved through the course like he was running drills. When an obstacle
shifted, he adjusted. When the path changed, he changed with it. He used mime
movements to predict the next shift—his hands showing him the rhythm before his
feet followed. The threads sang. He made it through seven obstacles. Eight.
Nine. The last one shifted, and instead of fighting it, he flowed with it.
Done. The course blazed gold.


================================================================================
SPREAD 10: CLIMAX - BIG ACTION - Meeting All Six Characters
================================================================================

Page 23 (Left) - All Six Arrive at Heart Crystal
-------------------------------------------------

Threads pulled Max toward the Heart Crystal's base. Five other kids stood
there, all looking shocked. "Noah? Elise?!" Max's sister Elise stared. "Max?!"
Maya, Micah, and Mona arrived from other paths. They were all here. All family.
"What are you ALL doing here?" The Heart Crystal cracked louder, light
stuttering. A massive pulse of energy pushed back against them. The crystal was
fighting them. "Together," Noah said. "We do this together."


Page 24 (Right) - Using Powers Together
----------------------------------------

"Each facet is different," Elise whispered, touching the crystal. Max saw his
facet—a complex pattern of obstacles etched in light. His challenge. "On
three," he said, falling into leader mode. "One... two... THREE!" Six hands
touched six facets. Max's facet activated, obstacles appearing in the air. He
had to complete them all while holding contact with the crystal. He moved,
adjusted, persisted. Around him, his cousins did the same.


================================================================================
SPREAD 11: CLIMAX CONTINUES - SAVING THE CRYSTAL
================================================================================

Page 25 (Left) - Max Completes His Challenge
---------------------------------------------

Max's obstacles shifted faster. He kept going. Jump. Adjust. Climb. Flow. His
family called encouragement. "You've got this, Max!" He was tired. His muscles
burned. But he didn't stop. He adjusted, adapted, kept moving. The final
obstacle appeared—three paths, all moving. He watched the rhythm, felt the
pattern, and jumped. He landed. His facet blazed brilliant orange.


Page 26 (Right) - Crystal Heals
--------------------------------

All six facets glowed together. The Heart Crystal's cracks sealed, light
flooding through every thread in Kathaél. The broken courses repaired
themselves, stronger than before. Max felt warmth gather in his palm until a
wristband appeared—golden, pulsing gently with orange light. He grinned at his
cousins. They'd done it. Together. "Did NOT see a family reunion in a magical
forest on today's schedule," he joked. Everyone laughed.


================================================================================
SPREAD 12: RESOLUTION (EMOTIONAL) + SERIES BUTTON
================================================================================

Page 27 (Left) - Returning to Ordinary World
---------------------------------------------

Max walked home, the wristband warm on his wrist. Around him, Kathaél's courses
moved in perfect rhythm, challenges restored. The fox sat on a branch, watching
him go. "Thanks for the workout," Max called. The fox's tail swished. The
basketball hoop gleamed ahead, exactly where he'd left it.


Page 28 (Right) - Transformed by the Journey
---------------------------------------------

Max picked up his basketball, the wristband humming softly. He took a shot.
Swish. He grinned. Not because he'd learned to accept failure. Because he'd
proven that genuinely hard challenges just need persistence and creativity. He
could adapt to anything. He shot again, adjusting his angle mid-release when
the wind picked up. Swish. At the tree line, a golden thread caught the light.
The fox tilted its head. Max waved. "Ready when you are."


================================================================================
                              THE END
================================================================================
