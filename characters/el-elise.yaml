  internal_conflict: |
    Elise is expressive, physical, and confident in her dance and song. She processes
    the world through movement—when she's thinking, she's dancing; when she's feeling,
    she's creating choreography. But she sometimes worries that her graceful, flowing
    style isn't powerful enough compared to bolder, more explosive performers. She
    wonders if gentle movements can create real change, or if only loud, forceful
    actions matter. Her journey involves discovering that intentional, graceful expression
    is its own kind of strength—that flowing persistence and embodied presence can heal
    what force cannot.
